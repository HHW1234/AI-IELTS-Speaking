{"input": "Is learning a new language important?", "target": "I would definitely say so. I feel that we better ourselves through each language we learn. For example, there is concrete evidence that language strengthens our cognitive (brain) abilities and problem-solving. Since I began my language studies, I feel that my memory has become much stronger and that I’m able to solve puzzles better. Furthermore, I’ve gained a greater understanding of my own native language! Second of all, language creates countless more opportunities for work and travel! Especially with English and Spanish we can travel to a wide range of countries. By being able to expand your customer base, you can achieve more business success. Furthermore, through languages you can discover a new culture, which makes you more open-minded, tolerant, empathetic, adaptable, among other things."}
{"input": "What benefits for one's career does knowledge of foreign languages bring?", "target": "Endless! In this globalizing world, it’s becoming a necessity to know at least one foreign language. Needless to say , English is the language of the world, so this is the most important one to learn to be able to communicate with the entire world. Behind these, I would say that Spanish and Mandarin are extremely useful, as well. By being able to communicate with more of the world’s population, you create opportunities to expand your business. On the other hand, since languages are proven to increase your cognitive functions and puzzle-solving skills, one who speaks more than one language may have stronger problem-solving skills in their career. Furthermore, since many language learners have lived or spent time abroad, they tend to be more adaptable and culturally understanding. All in all, it’s just a win-win (double benefit) to study other languages."}
{"input": "Who do you think learns a language faster, children or adults?", "target": "Definitely children! Since children’s brains are like sponges, absorbing new information, they undoubtedly pick up (learn) languages much faster. Furthermore, children’s memories are much sharper, so it is easier for them to remember new vocabulary. On the other hand, adults are more concrete in their native language and the world they’ve built from it, so they tend to be less open to accept another language. Children, on the other hand, can play games or watch cartoons in another language from a young age and pick up the language without even realizing it. The only advantage that adults have is that their behavior doesn’t stand in the way of their language learning, they are more motivated to learn, and that they are more likely to review and study at home. Furthermore, they pay for the classes, so they are much more invested (care about what they’re doing)!"}
{"input": "Describe a person who has interesting ideas or opinions.", "target": "I’m going to talk about my friend, Elliott, who is a natural (good at) at languages and always has a lot of interesting ideas when it comes to language learning and teaching. He is a fellow teacher at my workplace, so I feel I know him well enough to speak about him. First of all, he is fluent in THREE foreign languages, English, Chinese and Japanese, in addition to his mother tongue. So you can imagine, as a language teacher, he really stands out from the others. I feel that he has a special empathy for language learners. Although he has a knack (a talent) for languages, he knows that others struggle with them, so he always tries to come up with (invent) new methods to help language learners improve faster and achieve better results. In addition to imparting (communicating) knowledge, he always creates a fun atmosphere. For example, at the start of each class, he would have all the students stand up and play some warm-up games instead of going straight into doing routine teaching stuff. Some of the games are even invented by himself and I must say they are all well thought out (well-planned). I learn a lot from observing his classes and look forward to working more with him in the future. I’m really interested in learning more about how to make language learning fun."}
{"input": "What kinds of ideas are respected in your country?", "target": "That’s a tough question, but I’d definitely say any ideas that are groundbreaking (new) or revolutionary are very valued in my country. For example, we really respect people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, who changed future through technology. Furthermore, people who are forward thinkers are respected in today’s society, such as those who search for solutions to violence or support the gay rights movement. Lastly, people really respect those who have innovative business ideas, which improve the country’s economy. Actually, that might be the most respected one. All in all, we like those who are unconventional (unordinary) thinkers."}
{"input": "When do children start to have their own ideas?", "target": "They say that 7 is the “age of reason” (when kids know right from wrong), so I believe this is when it all begins, even if in small ways. I think this is the age where children begin to recognize their individuality and separateness from their parents. However, children tend to follow the belief system of their parents up to their teen years, when they start the rebellious years. Thinking back, I remember I started to question my parent’s religion and political ideas when I was around 15, leading me to break off (separate) from them. So, all in all, by the time you are 18, most teens know who they really are."}
{"input": "Where do these ideas come from?", "target": "The family is definitely the first foundation of how we shape our ideas. Apart from this, I would say teachers have the second largest influence. Following this, what kids hear in school, from their friends, what they watch on TV, and so on start to shape their way of thinking. Lastly, we start to break away (separate) from our family’s ideas and create our own ideas based on our life experiences."}
{"input": "Describe a good experience of online shopping.", "target": "I’m going to talk about a recent successful online shopping experience that I’ve had. To be honest, I’ve had countless incidents in which I ordered the wrong size or the product ended up being completely different than how it appeared online, so I was surprisingly delighted with this purchase. Well, let me tell you about it. Zara is my favorite store, and unfortunately there isn’t one currently near my house, so I decided to check out their online shopping site. I just started a professional job, so I’m always in need for more professional clothes. Zara always seems to fit me well and have classy, smart clothes, so I decided I would order a white dress from them. Luckily, the dress was on sale for"}
{"input": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping?", "target": "The advantages would be that it’s more convenient and saves loads of time, avoiding those dreaded lines. Furthermore, sites like Amazon tend to have secondhand items, so you can save a lot of money this way. The negatives are that you cannot try clothing on before, sometimes items don’t look the same in person, the shipping fees, and the time you have to wait for the item. By the same token, it’s a hassle to send it back if there’s an issue. So, all in all, there are more disadvantages, I’d say."}
{"input": "Do you think it is safe to shop online?", "target": "Depends on the site. If you use a reputable one like Amazon or the store’s website, it is generally very safe. However, buying from private sellers online, especially in their homes, can be risky. Furthermore, scams always exist online, so you never know if someone could be scamming you. I always say, if you have time, it’s better to go buy the item in person to gain more trust in the purchase."}
{"input": "Do you think the government should impose more control on online shopping?", "target": "Wow, this isn’t something I’ve ever thought about. In my opinion, I think the government should investigate to make sure sites are reputable, but that’s about all. I don’t think there should be any limit to what we buy, as long as they are legal products. Every purchase benefits the economy, so at this point I don’t see a need to regulate it."}
{"input": "Describe a singer that you like.", "target": "I would like to talk about one of my favorite singers, Sam Smith. He is a British singer and songwriter who has become popular in my lifetime. He is famed for his mellifluous (containing flow) voice and quality of his song lyrics, which are often romantic and soulful. Thinking back, I remember the first song I heard from him was “Latch”， circa I remember my roommate was playing it in her car and I asked who the singer was and decided to look him up. Ever since that day, I just fell in love with him. He constantly has new hits out on the pop radio stations! His songs are just super catchy (something you remember). I would consider his music to be a mix of soul and pop. I think he started as a soul singer, but his music has transformed into being more of a pop genre. I really like his music because there is always a good beat to it, and the lyrics speak to me on a deep level, causing me to feel emotional and identify with current dilemmas(problems) I’m facing. I like that some of his songs are more for dancing, while others are more deep and romantic. All in all, he is extremely talented and has a wide range. Sam Smith has a voice that really leaves a mark on you (impressive). I just love him!"}
{"input": "What kinds of music are popular in your country?", "target": "A wide range! Nowadays with youngsters, EDM music is all the rage (popular). Besides that, pop music, hip hop, alternative, and country are types of music that you hear most often on the radio. For example, my parents’ generations still sticks with their southern rock style of music, such as ACDC. Of all the music from the past, 80’s American music seems to be played on the radio the most often."}
{"input": "Do singers make lots of money?", "target": "Of course! Singers are some of the richest people in the world. However, I imagine that their pay may be cut due to the increase in Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, and the like instead of buying the records at stores. However, our generation idolizes (worships) celebrities, so they make incomparable profits from their social media posts, concerts, and just pure talent."}
{"input": "What do you think makes a song become popular?", "target": "Definitely by how catchy it is, for one. Also, how well the artist markets themselves. If they constantly get their songs into the Top 40, their songs will be heard by the entire world. Lastly, of course, the artist needs to talented and have something that makes their songs stand out (be unique) from the others, such as by having a lovely voice, good beat, etc."}
{"input": "Describe a time that you invited family or friends to have dinner at home or in a restaurant.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I invited my parents and grandparents over to my house for tortellini soup. I had just moved into my new house, so I was really excited for this housewarming event. Actually, I was extra excited because I just moved near my relatives after living across the country for years. I planned this event myself because I felt confident in my ability of making tortellini soup. Along with the soup, I prepared an Italian style salad and some warm, homemade bread with it. My mom passed the recipe down to me, so I had years of experience preparing it. I know it’s always a hit at social events! During the meal, we talked about memories of my mother, who had passed away 10 years before. Every time we eat her recipe, it always brings back memories of her. After that, we had small talk about our weekly plans and updates in our lives. Furthermore, my family asks me lots of questions about what home improvement plans I had for my new home, so I showed them the furniture and paint colors I had chosen for the house. We drank Pinot Grigio wine during the meal, which paired well with the Italian flavors. We met to catch up and enjoy my new home together. It was a simple yet very pleasant dinner party!"}
{"input": "Do people in your country prefer to eat at home or in restaurants?", "target": "Since I’m from a low-income country, people tend to eat at home rather than at restaurants to economize. Furthermore, the family is very central in my country, so all of the family members come together with the ingredients they have to cook a grand meal together on the daily. When we all pitch it, we all end up saving money and enjoying a higher quality meal than we would get at a restaurant."}
{"input": "What do people usually cook for special festivals?", "target": "Although seemingly strange or unappealing to others, guinea pigs are a delicacy in my country. For the Festival of the Sun in June every year, we prepare the guinea pig called “Cuy” and eat it home with our families, and even sell it on the streets. Sometimes we also prepare a cold dish called “Chiriuchu” which consists of chicken, guinea pig, fish eggs, and seaweed eaten cold. Still, I understand it doesn’t sound tasty to others, but I’m very fond it of it."}
{"input": "What would you say are the benefits and drawbacks of eating in a restaurant?", "target": "The benefits are that it is easier, more convenient, less work, and that you are able to try more international dishes whose ingredients you may never get to get your hands on. Also, at a restaurant, they often have interesting cocktails and appetizers to try with your meal. However, the disadvantages are that it’s more expensive, you tend to consume larger portions and more calories, and that you don’t know the real source of your food. In my opinion, it isn’t healthy to constantly eat at restaurants. They should be reserved for special occasions, if you want to try a specific food that you don’t know how to prepare, or if you’re in a pinch for time."}
{"input": "More and more people are having their meals delivered, so would people cook at home?", "target": "With the food delivery apps of today, I can see that less people are eating at home. In countries like America where fast food is cheaper than home-cooked meals, I can definitely see how people would choose that option over cooking at home. However, in my country, fast food is very expensive, so people cannot afford to eat out very often. Since we have ample markets with fresh, delicious ingredients available to us, it is not common to go out for meals other than for special occasions."}
{"input": "Describe an occasion you got up early in the morning.", "target": "To be honest, I was rarely out of bed by 8.00 AM apart from some specific occasions. However, there is an occasion I had to wake up earlier than usual which is my trip to ABC last summer vacation. I was supposed to get everything prepared the night before, so I did pack my suitcases with all the essential items that I might need for my vacation trip, like suntan cream or some swimming costumes. When the preparation was over, I try to send myself to sleep but ended up tossing and turning in bed, so you see, I hardly got a wink of sleep. When the dawn came, I went out to feel the gentle touch of a cool breeze on my face, then I also took a sip of coffee to get myself fully awake. After some minutes, the coach showed up and I got in no time. I took the trip with 2 of my besties, so we had the chance to catch up on gossip with one another. We also had fun at many outdoor activities on the beach like surfing. Although I was a bit exhausted at the end of the journey due to lack of sleep, it was definitely an enjoyable time. Since then, I have been less of a night owl and got up earlier, which I think is a better and healthier habit."}
{"input": "Do people in your country like naps?", "target": "Frankly speaking, the majority of people in my country seem to like taking a siesta in the afternoon. Understandably, it has been a proven fact that a short nap can recharge people’s batteries after an arduous morning working or studying. Having said that, some of my friends, for instance, aren't in the habit of taking such a short rest as they think a cup of coffee can do the trick and they’d rather save that time to complete their outstanding tasks at hand."}
{"input": "What time is better for teenagers to study, in the morning or at night?", "target": "Personally, I’d pick study in the morning simply because teenagers can have better concentration span. Specifically, after a night's rest, your body fully recovers and your minds are more refreshed, which can be conducive to the acquisition of knowledge. By contrast, after a backbreaking day at school or work, most teenagers often become lazy or sleepy, at this time what they wish to do is go to sleep right off the bat."}
{"input": "Why do people always say it’s healthy to eat breakfast?", "target": "Without a shadow of a doubt, breakfast is of great importance if we expect to have a productive day of working or studying. After a long night's rest, the body extremely needs energy which can be met by a supply of nutrients from a sumptuous breakfast. Also at this time of the day, the body's absorption rate is highest which means that the foods consumed would be digested properly and absorbed quickly into the body and turned into energy for the next working period."}
{"input": "Will working late at night influence the next day's work?", "target": "Absolutely yes. If you are being pressurized by a backbreaking deadline and have to burn the midnight oil completing it in time, the chances are that you will feel completely fatigued and lose your appetite the next working day. This is simply because a good sleep is important for your body to recover from exhaustion. What I mean here is that it's better if you turn in early and wake up earlier than being a night owl and lie in the next morning."}
{"input": "Describe a practical skill you learnt.", "target": "In my country, buying a car isn’t exactly a big deal, but driving a car is. It sounds a bit odd, doesn’t it? Well, if it does, then the reason for this is, it is extremely difficult to obtain a driving license in my country as it involves some rigorous driving and road tests. So, when I finally managed to pass the driving test a year ago or so, I felt as if I had landed on the moon. I had recently gone to a job interview in which they required the candidate to have their driver’s license. I was really intrigued by the job, so I decided to follow up on this. So, I went to a local car driving school and started to take driving lessons mostly on the weekends, as I worked during the week. Initially, the lessons involved learning about different parts of a car and their functions. Then came the actual driving lessons on the road by understanding and following different road signs and driving rules. Needless to say, the lessons followed some stringent driving standards which weren’t always easy to maintain, but that was exactly the real “test” in order to help a future driver understand the safety and security aspects of taking a car on the roads. Anyway, the lessons had continued for almost three months, and I was finally ready to take an official driving test to obtain a driver’s license. Anyway, I am glad that I had finally learned driving as it has allowed me the freedom to travel to my work and other places at my own pace and according to my agenda. Besides, learning this driving skill has also made me confident about applying for some well-paying jobs. Finally, learning how to drive has also allowed me to transport many bulky items in my car, which otherwise would have been really inconvenient for me if I had to take them on the bus like before. All in all, driving is just so useful."}
{"input": "Describe a time you visited a place with friends.", "target": "Well, I spend my spare (extra) time with my friends quite often. I'd especially like to talk about a time my friends and I traveled to Thailand after graduating medical school. After all those years of blood, sweat, and tears, we really deserved this trip. I vividly remember this moment because as soon as we got out of our final exams, we were all aboard on the way to Bangkok. 6 of us had originally agreed upon going, but finally 2 bailed at the last minute. When I think about it, it was an experience to bond more with just this small group. The main reason for visiting there was to get away from the stress gained from studying very hard. Speaking of what we did there, it was pure relaxation and discovery. We saw everything from the majestic pagodas and kingdoms in Bangkok to the pristine, white-sanded beaches in the Phi Phi Islands. Even more than just the incredible landscapes, the kind-hearted, welcoming people were what really left their mark on us. To sum up, we truly had a blast on this trip. It was really what we needed at the time! I’ll never forget the flavors of pad thai and bubble tea! It was 100% a blast."}
{"input": "Describe the information that was incorrect that you got.", "target": "Well, wrong information creates many difficulties in our lives. Sometimes we have to face danger due faulty (incorrect) details. So, here I would like to talk about a time when I got the wrong information from a website. About 3 years ago, my friend sent me an email with an attached link to something. He wrote me that it is a link to a website where there is an article related to a painting competition. I clicked on that link and a website was opened on my laptop’s screen within a few seconds. I read a piece of information related to a painting competition at the district level. It was going to organize an art gallery in my district, and it was necessary to register for it. So, I registered for this competition because I can paint a variety of paintings. The fee for this painting contest was about 50 dollars, so I paid it with my credit card. The competition would occur in ten days. I started my preparations for performing better in this competition. On the day of the competition, I went to Moga via bus and I arrived there at 8.00 A.M. I visited the correct place because I had received the venue from the website. I entered an art gallery named “Street Art”. I asked about this painting competition to reception. The receptionist told me that there would be competition held, even though I showed them a receipt which I got during registration. To add to it, He explained to me that there was an error on their ad regarding the date, and that he would do what he could to help me out. He apologized to me for this inconvenience, but I still couldn’t help but feel so disappointed. All in all, after that moment, I came back home. Now you see, wrong information causes inconveniences."}
{"input": "Would you say people trust the information that is found online?", "target": "In this day and age, people tend to believe everything they read online without even questioning it first. This is dangerous, as people sometimes write whatever they want online. Before we determine that information is trustworthy, we must consider the source. I think information can be trusted from sites with a .org/.edu at the end of it, as well as photographs for extra proof. For example, one safety precaution is to never go directly to someones’s house from the internet. It’s always better to meet at a public place first."}
{"input": "How can people check whether a piece of information is correct or not?", "target": "There are various means that can help people tell the right information from the wrong one. The first approach is to gain access to reliable sources of information, and make a comparison with the fraudulent information to see the differences. Dependable sources of news can be established newspapers like BBC, the New York Times and other verified news agencies. The second method is that people can ask for advice of professionals in the field, either by phone or email, and wait for some days to receive their feedback."}
{"input": "What are the most common ways in which people obtain information?", "target": "I think people obtain the larger share of their information from books and mass media like TV, newspapers and radio. And today since the Internet has grown exponentially, more and more people are getting their information from the web. There is an eclectic mix of stuff that those who go online can take advantage from, such as newsfeeds on social networking websites like Facebook, or informative contents from other electronic news platforms."}
{"input": "Describe a time when someone didn't tell you the whole truth about something.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I was really upset about someone lying to me. As I whole-heartedly value the truth, I feel very disappointed when I find out that someone has lied to me, especially when it’s someone close to me. So, I'll share this situation with you. I had just started dating a new guy and felt that I really liked him. I was 24 at the time, and he had said that he was 30. He appeared to be a bit older than that, so I tried to clarify his age twice, which he insisted was exactly 30. So, I decided to believe him. I was chatting with his best friend one day who was 32, and he made a comment saying that he was younger than Manny, which I was confused about at first. Later that day, I called Manny out (confronted) about that over text, in which after several lies finally confessed that he was actually 33 years old. I knew it wasn’t the most terrible lie someone could tell, but I felt that my trust in him was tested. I thought, “if someone lies about simple personal details, what else do they lie about?” He never stated his intentions about his lie, but I would imagine that maybe he felt he was too old for me. I guess that he was afraid to lose me if I knew he was 33, which wasn't a problem for me. Furthermore, maybe he was struggling with accepting his age himself, so he wanted to keep believing that he was 30. I’m sure it was related to his insecurities one way or another. Anyway, whatever his reasons were, I decided to give him another chance although I wasn't happy that he was dishonest."}
{"input": "Describe a person who helps others in his spare time.", "target": "I would like to talk about my co-worker, John, who is always willing to go the extra mile for others. As teachers, we constantly have a lot to do outside of the classroom. However, John utilizes his free time to be of service to others. For example, he sends his students extra materials every single day, always stays overtime to assist other co-workers, and even stops by work outside of work hours to bring us snacks. Whenever an emergency situation arises, he is always the first one to lend a hand. I believe he does this because he is a man of faith. Besides this, I think that people improve their well-being when they dedicate themselves to others. To him, it is no sweat to be of service to others- it’s simply a joy. I truly value John, as he is a rare breed. In this day and age, it’s uncommon to find someone who simply wants to do good without ulterior motives. I can say with full confidence that John isn’t looking for anything in return. All in all, John is just an excellent human being."}
{"input": "Describe a park or garden you visited and liked.", "target": "As a citizen in a metropolitan city, I am usually partial to choosing fresh outing spaces for relaxation after being up to my neck in work. Although there are many beautiful places in London, I would like to mention one in particular- Hyde Park. It’s a must-see for tourists. In the center of the hustle and bustle of London, Hyde Park is a beautiful oasis of trees, open space, and flowers. It’s a place where people go to have picnics, take a stroll, catch a breath of fresh air, etc. Well, my cousin and I went there for a jog on Sunday morning. Even though we are not morning people, we decided to push through to do this, and we are so glad! We jogged around the entire park which is approximately 5 kilometers, then we laid out some blankets and rested there among the greenery. It was the perfect way to recharge for the week. I really enjoyed this because it was an escape from city life. The work culture in London is demanding, so it’s nice to catch a break from time to time. Since I’m a salaried worker, I tend to spend over 40 hours working per week. I crave moments in nature after being confined to my desk all week. Furthermore, when I exercise, I find that I disconnect from the stress in my life and reduce it. All in all, it was a much needed day to escape our obligations!"}
{"input": "Describe a time you taught something new to a younger person", "target": "Well, since I’m a teacher, I teach new things to younger people on a daily basis. However, I will highlight one experience in particular that was really rewarding (gave me a personal benefit) to me. This would be when I taught a 4 year old student how to hold a pencil correctly and begin to write her first letters. Thinking back, this was about 2 years ago now. I usually teach high-school aged kids, but in this particular time I decided to take on a summer school program with 4-5 year old students. This girl who I taught to write was 4 years old, while the others were 5 years old, already having experience in kindergarten. I planned a lesson on the alphabet, assuming that all of them had previous knowledge of this. However, I had to sit beside the 4 year old girl to further assist her as she didn't have previous knowledge of this. We started off by holding the pencil together to form the letters, followed by me slowly easing (taking off easily) my hand off of it. I stayed beside her until she was able to write out her first letters. I’ll never forget the excited look on her face when she finally got the hang of it! As the class progressed, she was easily able to keep up (stay at the same speed as) with the 5 year olds. This was an extremely rewarding experience for me; I was just so excited. Since I had never experienced teaching a child a basic skill, it was really special to me. It made me start to think about raising my own family one day, especially standing beside my children at their milestones (big life events). I had never thought about how exciting it must be to be a parent! All in all, it was an emotional moment for me."}
{"input": "Describe a historical building you have visited.", "target": "I’m going to talk about the majestic Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca city tucked into (inside) the Andes Mountain range. More than 7,000 feet above sea level, Machu Picchu is the most visited tourist destination in Peru. A symbol of the Incan Empire and built around 1450AD, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007! It was such a humbling experience! I had always seen pictures of Machu Picchu and studied about its significance in school, but experiencing it in person made me realize that the pictures do it absolutely no justice (looks better in person). Upon arrival, you start to see intricate stone paths, walls, and buildings surrounded by mountain ranges, which frame the ancient city. There are irrigation systems and farming terraces extending down the mountains. Below it, there is fast-flowing river. You can tell they built this city intelligently! Furthermore, there are llamas throughout the structure, as well as tourists posing for selfies in every direction. The contrast between the bright green mountains with the stone city and agricultural terraces is truly breath-taking. On sunny days, you can see snow-capped mountain ranges even further in the distance! In this incredible place, I did a tour to learn about the history of the Incas and the detailed work and planning that went into building this place. For example, I learned that they suppose Machu Picchu was built to house the aristocratic class and that it was abandoned after the Spanish conquest. Furthermore, I learned that the Incas worshiped the sun, and that they had technology way ahead of their time (advanced), which reflects in their stonework, irrigation system, farming system, etc. As I had always been fascinated by the Incas, I decided to take this trip with my family to see it in person. I’m so glad I did! What a magnificent place it was."}
{"input": "Do people in your country often visit historical buildings?", "target": "To be honest, not really. As the US is a very new country, there aren’t many historical places to visit. Furthermore, since people tend to enjoy visiting the coast or modern places more, historical places are losing their value. Moreover, people usually only have a week of paid vacation per year, so they tend to visit family or take a family beach, camping, or mountain trip instead. Unfortunately, not too many people have the means, desire, nor the time to visit historical monuments."}
{"input": "Do children like to go to that kind of place?", "target": "I definitely think a child would be impressed by the sight of Machu Picchu, but I don’t like it would be the number one spot to take them. For example, there are steep drop-offs (steep hills) where a child could easily fall to their death. Secondly, it may be tiring for children to walk up the steep steps, and they could get bored during the several hour tour. On the other hand, I think children would get a kick out of (be entertained by) the llamas walking around the complex!"}
{"input": "Do you think people who damage historical relics should be put in prison?", "target": "Yes, in most cases! It is just insane that someone would do such a thing. I think this is such a heinous (horrible) crime for someone to destroy a piece of history. A person who would do such a terrible thing clearly doesn’t understand the value of historical relics. However, before putting the person in jail, authorities should determine the reason for it. Perhaps the person would do such a thing as a way to seek vengeance (revenge) for a historical event that deeply scarred them. Still, it is unacceptable for them to destroy it, but maybe the government should consider what historical landmarks mean to some."}
{"input": "Describe something a child did that made you laugh.", "target": "Often, children say and do the craziest things, as they lack the filter that adults have! It leads to lots of laughter. So, let me tell you about this child, Peter, who really made me laugh. He the child of one of my co-workers. It was Peter’s 3rd birthday party last week and I attended his birthday party. As I know Peter is a very active, rambunctious (naughty) child, I thought a water gun would be a suitable gift for him. So, I presented it to him and he was ecstatic (excited)! Peter sees many television shows and knows that the guns are used to shoot. So, he immediately started playing with the gun. He refilled the gun with water and pointed it to the guests and shot them with water! He wanted to have fun and did so. But finally, when the water ran out (emptied) and his parents did not allow him to refill with water, he shot them. When he shot his dad, the dad fell on the ground. When he shot his mother, she also fell in the ground as if she died. He was surprised. He could not decide what to do. So, he shot himself and fell beside his mother until they stopped pretending to be dead. The entire event was hilarious (really funny), and all of the guests were roaring in laughter. In fact, the kid was highly clever and his gestures made me laugh. He was confused what to do when he shot his parents. So, finding no other options left, he killed himself. In fact, it proves his guilt but the representation of the situation was really interesting that everyone could not stop laughing with this scenario. Despite the issue being a serious one, it was a kind of comical event. So, I laughed with my whole heart. In fact, it was the rapid decision making skill of the child and the implementation of the decision without any hesitation was the key element of the genuine laughter."}

{"input": "\"Describe a person you wanted to be similar to when you were growing up.\"", "target": "\"Today I’ll tell you about how I used to want to be like my sister when I was younger. She was always the popular, scholarly type, while I was sort of the unfocused, social outcast (unpopular) type. I always struggled with my weight when I was younger even though I ate pretty healthily, whereas my sister always had a perfect, thin physique (fitness) even while eating junk food constantly. My sister is 2 years older than me, and we grew up together. She was always at the top of her class, even though she studied very little. I remember her saying that she would forget to study, but still get nearly 100% on her exams, even through her college years. Moreover, she had a natural athletic ability with very little effort. She could take up a new sport and be good at it at the drop of a hat! I envied her swimming and basketball skills, especially. Apart from this, she was the thin, pretty blonde girl that everyone wanted to be friends with, although she didn't have to put effort into being nice to people. Another thing I looked up to her for was that it was easy for her to speak her mind. When I was younger especially, I always found it difficult to speak up even when I was being treated unfairly. Reflecting back, I think what I most wished to inherit from her was her ability to do everything at ease. It seems like I always had to put more effort into school to get good grades, be fit, have friends, etc, so I wished those things could come easier. I especially wished I had her athletic ability, as I would like to do more physical activity. Furthermore, I wish I didn't have to spend countless hours studying and even meeting with a tutor to get good grades. However, as I’ve gotten older, I realize that we cannot compare ourselves to other people because we all have different strengths and weaknesses. Still, I admire her for her abilities as well as her outspokenness.\""}
{"input": "Describe a quiz program or game show on TV. You should say: What it is, When you watch it, What it is about, And explain how you feel about the program.", "target": "I’m going to talk about a quiz show called “Who wants to be millionaire?”. As it famous all over the globe, I’m sure you’ve heard of it before. It can be viewed by everyone, as it is family friendly. Well, let me tell you how it works. At the start of the show, the contestants gather and prepare to answer a multiple choice question to decide who gets to be in the “hot seat”. Naturally, it’s the person who answers accurately within the shortest time frame. When a contestant is selected, he or she will proceed to sit in a chair in the center and have the opportunity to answer a total of 15 questions that become progressively more difficult. For every answer that you answer correctly, you are awarded a determined amount of money. Apparently, if you’re unsure of one particular question, you can always stop the game and go home with the money that you have allotted at that time. However, if you are willing to take your chances, you can follow your instinct and keep going. Also, there are always three “aids” you can use, for example you can call your friends for help, or choose to have half of the options eliminated. All in all, I enjoy this game because it’s very suspenseful: it always keeps me on the edge of my seat! Furthermore, I gain knowledge from watching this show. Since I have 2 teenage children, I like that it is something that we can all watch together!"}
{"input": "Do people in your country like to watch TV?", "target": "Too much! People in my country are definitely couch potatoes (people who like to stay on the sofa all day). Since it’s always rainy here, people tend to stay indoors and watch Netflix quite often. With a raging entertainment industry, there is always some hot new TV series coming out, which leaves people on the edge of their seats (anxious; excited)."}
{"input": "What games do children play nowadays?", "target": "In this technological world, children are shifting more towards video games, as well as games on their cell phones or tables. Actually, I was shocked the other day when I walked past a group of elementary kids who were all simultaneously staring away at their cell phones, lost in their games. I always get on (push) my children to go outside and take a bike ride or a walk instead of staring at their X-box all evening long."}
{"input": "Are there any differences between the games children's games and adults' games?", "target": "Yes, to an extent. First of all, kids tend to have more energy, so they like games like tag where they can run around like crazy. Furthermore, kid’s games are usually more cartoon character based games, or educational games that work on building soft skills. Since adults already have these skills, their games are usually based on creativity or a higher intelligence level. However, there are many similarities of all games, considering most are based on entertainment and problem-solving skills."}
{"input": "Describe a regular thing you do every day.", "target": "Since the start of 2019, I promised myself to exercise more to lead a healthy lifestyle. So far so good! Let me tell you about my usual workout routine. Well, luckily my apartment complex has a fitness center, so I use this gym the most often, as it’s extremely convenient. Additionally, I have a gym membership at another fitness club, as well as exercise outdoors on days with pleasant weather. When I go to the gym, I usually spend 30-60 minutes doing cardio, in which I alternate between the bicycle, treadmill, and elliptical. After this, I move on to some light weight-lifting to help tone my body. For example, I do some triceps (muscle in your arms) exercises to thin out my arms, or some crunches (abdomen exercise) to harden up my abs (abdominals). So, between the cardio and weight lifting, I spend about an hour and fifteen minutes at the gym per day. I do this because it benefits my mental and physical health. Exercise releases endorphins (a brain chemical), which cause you to feel happier. Furthermore, I feel more confident when I work out. Also, I feel that I have more leeway (freedom) on what I can eat when I exercise, as I’m known for having a sweet tooth (likes sweet food). Lastly, I’ve been wanting to shed (lose) some extra pounds, so exercise definitely aids in this. All in all, there’s no way to argue that exercising is loaded (full) with benefits!"}
{"input": "Describe a product or application which is based on artificial intelligence.", "target": "Artificial intelligence, the latest front in computer science, is affecting all fields of technology, continually making our lives easier. Nowadays there are countless (many) apps and products in existence thanks to artificial intelligence, but I would like to talk about one I’m especially fond of (like), which is the robot vacuum cleaner, especially the Samsung powerbot. I’ve always been a bad sweeper, so this is an ideal creation for me. I was gifted one for Christmas last year and I’ve been in love with it ever since! Instead of sweeping the floors, the robot vacuums are battery operated machines which go all over your house to pick up all the dirt, animal fur, and dust for you! All you have to do is put batteries in them and empty them out after they do their rounds (go around). You can even program it to sweep the floors at a specific time daily! The interesting thing about them is that they remember the map of the room and have a sensor to know when they are approaching another object, and then turn away. Furthermore, they sense when they have sufficiently cleaned the floors then return back to their charging station home-base. I think this is such a brilliant invention, as I usually miss dirt when I sweep the floors myself. Although it’s pricey, about $300 per machine, I believe it’s worth it for the time and efficiently of it. Since a lot of people track dirt into the house when they enter, this is a sure way to keep the floors constantly clean and tidy. All in all, I’m a huge fan of it (I really like it)!"}
{"input": "Can Artificial Intelligence be conscious?", "target": "Mmm...not really. I know they are programmed to sense when someone is near them or enters the room, but I’m unsure of whether they are really conscious. For example, with more advanced robots such as Erica, I do believe she has feelings and her individual personality. Furthermore, I know she has a very developed “brain”. On the other hand， I know that Alexa or Siri don’t have a conscious. They simply respond with a series of programmed responses. Perhaps it’s just my own bias (preference), but I’m firm in the fact that I don’t believe that robots’ emotions could never match humans’."}
{"input": "How does AI help us in everyday life?", "target": "Alexa helps us to check the weather, save electricity by turning the lights off when we leave the room, remembers our favorite playlists, etc. More than anything else, she reduces the amount of monotonous (boring and repetitive) tasks we are used to doing and makes our lives easier. I believe there are more benefits than drawbacks to her presence. On the other hand, we shouldn’t rely too heavily on Al, since technology can fail us at any given second."}
{"input": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of AI?", "target": "I would say the advantages are that it saves time, reminds us to conserve electricity, makes listening to music easier, provides easier navigating, and is simply rather amusing. On the other hand, I don’t think there are any drawbacks (disadvantages) to her except the fact that people become to reliant on technology and tend to get irrate when it fails them. For example, I always go to my friend’s house and when Alexa can’t understand what he said, he will start to holler at her! I think people build too high of expectations for technology, assuming it should be just as intelligent as a human, which causes people to lose their tempers (get angry)."}
{"input": "Describe a prize you want to get.", "target": "The prize I would like to get is from a quiz show called “Who wants to be millionaire?”， known all of the world. I’m sure you are familiar with this, so it’s unnecessary to explain every detail of how it works. So, I’ll describe it briefly. It is roughly like this, contestants have to answer in total 15 questions that get increasingly more difficult. For every answer that you get right, you’ll be awarded a determined amount of money. Apparently if you’re not sure about one particular question, you can always stop the game and go home with the money. But if you’re feeling adventurous you can just go with your instinct. And there’s always three “aids” you can use, for example you can call your friends for help, or choose to have half of the options eliminated. Winning first prize, which means nailing (getting correct) all 15 questions, is what I’m aiming for. The game requires you to know a bit of everything, so I’m reading up on areas that I’m not interested in or familiar with. I’m also looking for people who I can call for help during the program. I’m planning on entering the competition next month!"}
{"input": "Is it good to have competition?", "target": "I think competition is healthy to an extent. But, I think the number one person we should compete with is always ourselves. Being better than we previously were is the number one priority, in my opinion. However, team and individual competitions are also a healthy and necessary way to motivate people to try their hardest and gain a sense of teamwork and sportsmanship (respect to the other team whether you win or lose). By the same taken, failure is also a great lesson to help us to be better in the future. We all need failure just as much as we need success!"}
{"input": "Do you think it's good to award prizes in school and university?", "target": "Yes, I believe so. By setting a prize, we give the students incentive to learn and try their hardest. Awards like Student of the Month, Perfect Attendance Awards, Dean’s List, etc. are something that boosts the confidence of the student, and may even benefit their future when they add these achievements onto their CVs. Furthermore, while school can be a dry, dull place, adding competitions adds a level of entertainment, which makes it a more fun environment. Moreover, even if a student loses a competition, that failure can be transformed into a positive lesson down the road (in the future). Of course there are always some students and parents who take it too far, but all in all, it is a healthy and much needed practice in the school system."}
{"input": "Do you think companies should give their employees prizes?", "target": "Definitely! Awards like Employee of the Month, promotions, and so on motivate employees to give their best in their jobs. If employees always give 100% and never receive anything in return, they may feel that there is no incentive to work hard. For those who are naturally competitive, this is a necessity to them. Of course some employees may become jealous or resentful (hateful) of others, but it is also a motivating factor to build a sense of sportmanship and will make them want to work even harder the next time around."}
{"input": "How to reward successful people?", "target": "Truth be told, rewards for successful people should come in plenty of forms. If they make an enormous contribution to the nation, then they should be given proper publicity. For example, a veteran who fought bravely or a hero who sacrificed their life for the peace of a country should be remembered forever in sculptures and paintings. On the other hand, successful businesspeople who play a significant role in the development of their nation’s economy should be awarded with medals or certifications so as to stimulate them to make even greater contributions in the future."}
{"input": "Should schools establish awards? What rewards can children get from school?", "target": "From what I see, I guess it is quite well-advised for schools to have a reward system to encourage good deeds and academic performance amongst students. Students would be a helpful citizen if schools add extra points to their academic record for talking an elder across the street, offering to lift a heavy object for a passerby on the street, for example. On top of that, academically poor students can feel the motivation to strive further in their studies to reap the rewards, like they can obtain some pocket money for being the top student in the class during a semester. This can greatly spur their scholastic progress."}
{"input": "Should parents push their children to get prizes?", "target": "Children are at an impressionable age, so adults can interfere in their ways of thinking. Some measures can be adopted to change children’s mindset, and one is by raising their awareness via realistic and practical action. Parents can show their kids that they can do rapid calculations if they learn math properly at school, or they can sing well when they grow up if they don’t skip music classes."}
{"input": "What do you think employers can do to help motivate their employees to perform better at work, besides giving them a pay raise?", "target": "There is a number of ways that bosses or supervisors can adopt to raise their employees’ morale and enhance the overall work productivity apart from offering them higher salary. I guess the most effective approach would be for companies to organize annual excursions so that their workers can socialize with one another and cultivate team spirit while they can escape from the stress for a while. The second one is that more a flexible working schedule should be brought in, because this would allow workers to have more quality family time and a worry-free set of mind at work."}
{"input": "Describe an important technological product you bought.", "target": "I consider myself lucky to have a job in a multinational company, which caused me to buy a laptop for my ordinary use at home. I’m very satisfied with this purchase, so I would love to share the story. Well, let me give you some background. I am the eldest daughter of my family and live with them here in India. I recently got a job which requires me to complete digital tasks online. Besides, it has become impossible for me to use the internet with my old cell phone. Considering everything, I have bought a laptop from the Dell brand shop online. Though I saved a portion of money from sources like private tuition for the laptop for a long time, the best opportunity came when I got appointed to this multinational company. I added the remaining from my salary and brought the laptop home. This is the age of technology and using the internet with mobile phones is not very efficient. Someone may browse the internet or social networking websites temporarily on a mobile network, but that is not suitable for any large scale jobs. Often I have to perform some official tasks using the internet and this is almost impossible by using the cell phone. Besides, I like watching movies for recreational purposes and my cell phone is unable to come with such support for me. Moreover, my parents are devoutly religious and love listening to guided prayers on there. Considering all such matters, I decided to get a laptop but unfortunately could not manage the entire amount. So, when I received my paycheck, I bought it right away! I bought the laptop last month and have been using for around three weeks. By this time, the laptop has proved its worth. It holds an outstanding charge-usually about 7 hours. Besides, my parents are also using it and they are happy too. I planned to use the internet modem but my father has arranged a broadband internet connection. So, using the internet is no longer a problem for us. I have two younger sisters and they are also careful about using the laptop. They mostly use the laptop when I am not home and watch cartoons and animated movies on the internet. My mother takes care of the laptop and she is responsible for keeping it safe and clean from dust. I was really happy to buy this laptop. It may sound strange to some that it was a dream for me. I have realized the necessity of a laptop when I was at my university. I was unable to complete projects and assignments. I had to rely (depend) on my friends who had their own laptops. Though they cordially allowed me to use their laptops, I felt uncomfortable most of the time. On the other side, my family was not fortunate enough to spend some extra bucks(dollars) for me to buy a laptop. So, I made a plan to make this dream come true. After lots of struggles, I got the job and finally have my own laptop. All in all, I couldn’t live without it now!"}
{"input": "How much has technology improved how we communicate with each other?", "target": "This is a controversial (debatable) topic. On one hand, communication had opened up endless windows of opportunities to reach a broader spectrum (range) of people, keep in touch (contact) with people better, and just all in all made communication more accessible. For example, I lived across the world, but I still felt close to my family, thanks to FaceTime. On the other hand, I believe it has had a negative effect on how we communicate with others. Where in the past we used to value discussing matters at face value, we now hide behind computer screens. I even feel I am scared to confront people face to face when I could make it easier over the phone or via text message/email. All in all, there are positives and negatives to it."}
{"input": "Do you agree that there are still many more major technological innovations to be made?", "target": "Of course! Endless, actually. There is more that will be created than we can even imagine at this particular moment in time. Looking back, I could never have dreamt in my wildest dreams all that is accessible to us nowadays. I’m anxious to see what will be available to us in the future! I can imagine hologram (digital) image video chats!"}
{"input": "Do you think people rely too much on technology?", "target": "At times! I think people are becoming incapable of doing things the old school way, and with that said losing real skill. For example, I am a teacher and we rely so heavily on videos, smartboards, audio files, etc, that when technology fails us, we are completely lost. Furthermore, I must be connected to my phone, email, and text messages at all times to even function. Moreover, I see that children are starting to not be able to enjoy life without a tablet or phone, whereas kids enjoyed playing outside and getting dirty in the past. So yes, in this world where a wifi connection can fail us in an instant, people often rely too heavily on it."}
{"input": "Could you suggest some reasons why some people are deciding to reduce their use of technology?", "target": "I’m seeing that people are starting to realize that they can’t enjoy the moment they are in because they are always glued to(attached to) their phones. Furthermore, they want to reduce the amount of time they stare at at a computer screen all day, as it is straining and damaging to our eyes. Moreover, parents want to try to manage the time their kids spent playing video games, encouraging them to get more fresh air. With the app that records the amount of time that you spent on social media a day, it’s a bit shameful to see how much time we waste away, so people are taking action against it."}
{"input": "Describe something that you brought home from a tourist attraction.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about my most recent trip in which I purchased a special souvenir. Well, a few months ago I went to Switzerland on holiday and brought home a painting from a local shop in Zurich. It was a bit of a hassle (annoying) to bring home because of the high taxes in the airport. However, it was such a nice piece of painting that it was worth it. It was a large oil painting that depicts (describe) a beautiful natural scenery common in Switzerland and not quite common in my homeland. I have hung it in my bedroom and it is now one of the most beautiful and cherished (special) souvenirs for me. I went on this trip in early March with my 2 friends. The alpine scenery, picturesque (attractive& interesting) villages, glittering (bright and shining) blue lakes, beautiful lakeside and astounding (appalling) tranquility of the villages took our breath away. Since we are artsy people, we attended an art festival in the mountains where I found this painting. As I don’t like keychains or T-shirts as much, I decided to bring this home as my only souvenir. Now, every time I look at this painting, it reminds me the exciting and memorable days I had spent on our holiday in Switzerland. Apart from that, the painting is a bit different than the other paintings I have in our house, so it really stands out (noticeable; different). This picture takes me back (to remind someone of something in the past) in time."}
{"input": "What kinds of souvenirs do people usually buy from tourist attractions?", "target": "Well it depends on the person, but I would say the most common souvenirs are keychains, mugs, magnets, shot glasses, art items, T-shirts, etc. I would say that people who have some sort of vice such as drinking or smoking usually go for a souvenir that suits this, such as a local liquor or a cigar from the specific place. However, children tend to buy some sort of toy or T-shirt related to the place. On the other hand, women tend to buy a clothing item or perhaps an accessory such as earrings, a necklace, or a scarf, where men tend to buy some sports memorabilia or the like."}
{"input": "Is it good that the locals sell things to tourists?", "target": "Yes! For many places, tourism is one of the only industries, so they have to take advantage of this. For example, a local can really benefit from selling their homemade crafts to a tourist. Of course the local benefits financially, but they could also get their name out there (become well-known/famous), while leaving the tourist with a one of a kind gift. On the other hand, the locals shouldn't be too aggressive or rip off (cheat financially) the tourists because it could turn the tourists off to the place. It's all a balance!"}
{"input": "Do you prefer to buy souvenirs or useful things? Why?", "target": "As I’m more of a practical person, I prefer to buy useful things or more experiences in the particular place that I visit. For example, I would much rather spend those $10 on a special meal or put it towards a tour rather than buying a T-shirt that I may never wear again. Furthermore, I’m really into photography, so a memorable moment captured in time is much more valuable than a magnet, mug, or shot glass could ever be to me. To celebrate my travels, I showcase my photography on social media and frame the pictures to hang on my walls."}
{"input": "What is your opinion about the asking price for souvenirs?", "target": "It depends! For example, I would never let myself be gouged (charged an unreasonably high price) buying a last-minute souvenir at an airport. Along with just the airports, many places elevate the prices in touristy areas. I think it's a bit unfair, but it's just kind of how it is. Of course I wouldn't want to be ripped off, but I can also understand that this is a good opportunity for especially impoverished countries to make money from wealthier tourists. In my opinion, the best souvenirs to buy are handicrafts from humble, local people on the streets or in a small shop."}
{"input": "Describe a time you looked for information from the internet.", "target": "I’m going to talk about this time when I needed a foreign book for my studies. I was in my senior year in university and we had this assignment that required us to find the latest medical breakthroughs (new information) on cancer, some of which are very hard to come by. So, I knew I needed to find this book ASAP. Apparently in order to get access to new data you must know the right source and pay some fees. I found out that the breakthroughs that I needed were published in a book, which was not yet for sale in my country. Moreover, even if I’d had it delivered, it would be too late by the time it arrived at my doorstep. I felt really uptight about it, but suddenly I thought of a solution. So, I decided to contact my former host family in the US to ask them to buy a hard copy then have the specific information scanned and emailed to me. It took some time but eventually I got the data in time. It was a bit of a hassle (something time-consuming) for my host family, so I decided to buy him a small gift in return."}
{"input": "What influence does the internet have on people (individually), and the society?", "target": "Well, for one, before the internet people interacted much more when meeting up and going out together, now you see people glued to (always looking at) their phone screens. Their focus is on their social media apps looking at what their friends and family are doing through photos and status updates, rather than actually talking to them. Communication is mostly through social media, with instant chat, cutting the need for face to face meetings. On the other hand, the internet has had a positive impact on society because now we can accomplish much more in a shorter time frame. Moreover, people can access information much quicker through google for example, so it creates a generation of well-informed people. Because of this, I believe that our future is very bright."}
{"input": "Do you think libraries will disappear one day?", "target": "I think this could be a possibility, as people are beginning to think that libraries are redundant (unnecessary), as the information is also available online. With devices such as E-books, Kindles, Amazon, etc., it’s normal to question how much longer libraries will last. For example, I never use the library because I see it as a hassle to have to check out the book and return it when I could just buy a used copy for next to nothing online from Amazon or borrow it from a friend. However, I still believe that a lot of people like to utilize libraries for the tangible value of holding a book in your hand and having a quiet, serene place to study; libraries have always been a staple to our academic world. So, with all of this said, I think libraries will stay around for at least the next 20 years."}
{"input": "What do people use the internet for?", "target": "Pretty much everything! Nowadays, there are countless apps at our fingertips to accomplish all of our tasks. For example, we use the internet to do research, pay our bills, find a dating match, go shopping, make phone calls, find jobs, chat with friends, find work out videos, etc. The better question would be what we don’t use the internet for nowadays. To be honest, I can’t think of any area of life where we don’t use the internet."}
{"input": "Would you say many people waste time \"surfing the internet\"?", "target": "For sure! Nowadays, the average person spends hours surfing the internet each day. Take me for example. My phone has recorded that I spend an average of 2 - 3 hours a day surfing the web on my phone, not to mention the 6 hours I’m constantly connected to it to carry out my work tasks. In some respects, it’s very useful to google things that you may be curious about throughout the day, but many people spend time surfing instagram or facebook watching lives of people they don’t even know, which is a 100% waste of time in my opinion."}
{"input": "How do you think people will be using the internet in 10 years (time)?", "target": "That’s a great question! It’s difficult to imagine this, but I would imagine we will continue to use it in all the respects that we do nowadays, but even at a more elevated level. For example, I’ve often speculated that we will have hologram images instead of video chats. On the other hand, I have a feeling that the online classroom will soon replace the traditional classroom. When it comes to the work world, I imagine that even more jobs will become remote. All in all, the world will continue to advance technologically."}
{"input": "Describe a city you went to with your family.", "target": "My family and I always had a dream vacation of going to New York city, better known as the Big Apple. The concrete jungle (a nickname for New York) where dreams come true. I would have to say that those were some of the best days of my life. It was around Christmas time, so we really wanted to see the decked out (decorated) New York that we had always seen on TV. Let me tell you how it came about So, by the end of 2018 we caught a flight from Portland to New York. I have to say that New Yorkers truly have the Christmas spirit. All of the city looked fairytale from Disney movies. While we were wandering around (walking around) the city, we saw a huge Christmas Three full of beautiful lights and sparkling star on top. It really took us back to the Home Alone movies! Seeing all of the Christmas decorations was the most outstanding part of the trip. Actually, it made me feel emotional to be standing there experiencing this with my family. It touched all of our hearts a lot. In conclusion, this trip took my breath away."}
{"input": "Do you think cities worth visiting is also suitable to live in?", "target": "Yes, I do. They are worth visiting for a reason. Whether they have iconic (famous) locations or fantastic restaurants, I would say that a city is not only worth visiting, but is also worth living. I’m a fan of (I like) the countryside too, but I always like to check out the capital city of a country too."}
{"input": "Do people in your country like to travel?", "target": "People in my country do love to travel a lot, mainly to Europe because you can breathe culture (take in) and history in every single country you visit, and countries are so small over there, that you can go through one of them in just 4 hours of driving, that’s fantastic!"}
{"input": "How has travelling changed, compared to several decades ago?", "target": "Well, several decades ago, travelling was more of a luxury option for people with a lot of money. Nowadays, it has changed and become more accessible to the middle class. You can easily get a roundtrip tickets to Paris for less than 200 dollars, before, that was bananas (crazy)!"}
{"input": "When do people travel (as tourists), who do they usually go with?", "target": "When people travel, they usually go with friends or family. Those ways are the most common, but for me the best way to travel is by yourself. It’s becoming more common for people to travel alone, but for me especially because I love the feeling of being able to do whatever I please at any given moment."}
{"input": "Do you think the internet has had an effect on people’s traveling behavior today?", "target": "It has deeply affected the way people travel, particularly in the way people buy plane tickets and layout their days at destination. Thanks to the internet, now you can buy plane tickets immediately, all you need to have is a credit or debit card. People also pick up their destination and determine what to do each day, based on the information they find online."}
{"input": "If you were going on a trip, what essential modern technology would you take with you, and why?", "target": "One of the essentials on my trips is my phone. I can’t survive without it, it brings me so much information about destination, like how to get there and what to see. To be honest, I’d be completely lost without google maps! I need all of that information right in the palm of my hand (accessible) to be able to proceed with my trip."}
{"input": "Describe a journey that you went on by car", "target": "It was the day before the long weekend of Labor Day and I had nothing to do, no plans, nothing at all. So, I decided to give my friends a shout (call my friends). Luckily, they were also free so we decided to spend this holiday together to celebrate all the hard work we do. This is how we started the road trip and I didn’t know it was going to be an outstanding experience. Let me tell you about it! We decided to go to the Grand Canyon, a place with beautiful landscapes and stunning hikes during the sunset. As soon as we arrived, the first task we completed was to set up the tents and a small fire near us because it was a pitch-black (very dark) night. We were lucky enough to see a shooting star going above our heads. The next morning, we woke up really early to start one of the most famous hikes of the area. I would have to say that it was worth every second of it. As we packed everything back to the cars to go back to the city, we saw a giant raven (large bird), trying to eat some leftovers from other camping grounds. That was just the perfect way to end the trip— in primitive (old) nature, yet having fun at the same time. That weekend was something else (something really special). I felt it was a bonding experience to get to know my friends more, as well as a nice time to unwind (relax) from our hectic (busy) lives in the city. In conclusion, it was one heck of a weekend (an awesome weekend)!"}

{"input": "Is driving skill important?", "target": "Indeed, it is not just important, it’s a necessity here in the US. Unlike Europe, cities were built for cars, not people, here."}
{"input": "Describe a time you spent a lot of money on something.", "target": "Well, let me tell you about a time I spent a lot of money. It was Christmas time, but also it was time to get a gift for myself. After a long year of hard work, not to mention a grueling (very difficult) one, it was time to spoil myself a little bit. I knew exactly what I wanted, which was the latest iPhone. I had had mine for about 3 years and I knew it was time for an upgrade. So, I carefully saved up money throughout the year so make sure I could provide this for myself at the end of the year. The day before Christmas I went into the C Train that takes to downtown and from the train station, I walked to about 15 minutes and I arrived at the Apple Store. I knew it was going to be a lot of money but I was aware that those products last for a very long time, that’s why I decided to get it. After leaving the cashier counter and leaving most of my money, I rapidly (quickly) went back to the train station with my bag on my hands and headed home. When I arrived there, I was so excited to open it as test the new phone. In conclusion, it was worth it!"}
{"input": "Why do young people tend to waste money?", "target": "People tend to waste more money because they like to flex (try to look cool) or pretend in front of their friends. They want to show that they can afford things that maybe the other can’t like the latest iPhone or expensive vacations. So, it’s all something superficial for young kids."}
{"input": "Why is it important for people to save some of their money?", "target": "Saving money is important because you don’t know how the future is going to be, maybe you will go through rough times where you wish you’ve saved all the money you spent on mundane objects. Still, I think it’s all about balance. Don’t fret (worry) over money too much, but also don’t spend it like a drunken sailor (like a crazy person)."}
{"input": "Should children be taught how to manage money?", "target": "Children should be taught how to manage their money, it is very important that from the very beginning we all know how to make the best use of our money- it could be saving or investing. Instead of learning so many mathematical skills that we may never use in the school system, I think they should have more classes like this."}
{"input": "Who is better at saving more money, men or women?", "target": "I would say that it does not depend on the gender, it depends fully in the kind of education we received as kids and also in schools. They say that men can be impulsive, but I know a fair share of women who are the same. On the other hand, perhaps women spend more on physical maintenance, but by the same token (in the same way), there are also many men who do so."}
{"input": "Describe a teenager you know", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a family friend of ours named Edward. He is 16 years old and bright (clever; intelligent) as can be. We have known him ever since he was 6 years old, and I’ve enjoyed watching him transform into the young man he is today. Nowadays, he’s even taller than me! I would say he’s almost 6 feet tall. He has a dark complexion and nearly black hair, now cut into one of the trendy styles with one side of it shaved. He’s blossoming into (changing into; like a flower) a handsome fellow (another word for boy or man)."}
{"input": "Why do you like him/her", "target": "I really care for Edward because he has always been an honest, polite kid and a joy to be around. He isn’t like the typical rebellious teenager who feels they are too cool for everything and everyone around them. He always greets me with a hug and shows me a lot of respect. For this reason, I have really taken a liking to him. On another note, he is extremely hard-working and intelligent."}
{"input": "\"Describe a time the vehicle you were travelling in broke down.\"", "target": "\"Well, there is no doubt that the invention of vehicles made our lives more convenient and comfortable. Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, distances are made much shorter since there are various modes of transportation available such as buses, trains, bikes, and cars. Most of the time, I prefer to use my own car for traveling. Luckily, I had not faced many problems with my car. However, I would like to share an incident when my car was broken down on the side of the road while traveling. A couple of months before, I traveled to Leeds with my husband. We started our journey full of excitement but unfortunately, when we reached the 100k mark, suddenly our car started making a strange noise. We stopped the car on the left side of the road and tried to check out the issue. Although we didn't find any problem, the sound of the engine was becoming louder and louder. After a few minutes, the whole situation became worse, and we even saw smoke coming out of the engine! This was the first time our car gave us such trouble. Luckily, my husband had a service center number in his pocket. So we called a mechanic for car repair. By the grace of God, the service center was near us, so a mechanic arrived in five minutes. He checked the car's engine properly and replaced a belt as well as the coolant. All in all, it took an hour to repair. Finally, our car's engine started again and we felt extremely relieved to see it work properly. My feelings of frustration instantly went away. All in all, it was a smooth fix.\""}
{"input": "Describe a time you gave advice to others.", "target": "I tend to have close relationships with my friends, and am always eager (ready) to help them out. I have this friend in particular who I’ve grown up with (known since children); we’re pretty close. I will tell you about some serious career advice I gave him recently. Well, here’s some background: Last year he was working at an international company and doing quite well, so he was offered a big promotion to become a manager. However, he had also been looking for opportunities to study abroad, and had recently received an offer from a prestigious university around the same time he got the job offer. It was a scholarship that would cover all expenses, including tuition and accommodation, an enviable package. So, he was really in a pickle (in a difficult situation) over what to do. It was tough for him to decide whether to pursue his career or his education. So, we met up to discuss this. When he asked for my advice, I told him that if he wanted to be successful in his field, he needed to possess excellent qualifications. If he didn’t, there would be a limit to how far he could reach. Although this promotion may look good now, there may be a small window (limits) for growth. After this advice, he decided to take my advice and is now studying at Yale. All in all, he saw that pursuing his education would pay off (benefit) more in the future."}
{"input": "Describe a period of time in the history of your country that you want to know more about.", "target": "Well, my country has been through several historical events under various rulers and governments. This has led to the long and highly fascinating (interesting) history of my country to be written for everyone to know and benefit from. I am fond of (like) reading history in general, however, the most fascinating period to me is from the year 1940 to 1947. It was the last phase of the Indian independence movement while still under British rule. With this said, the British rule in India lasted for nearly two hundred years. It was in 1947 on the fifteenth of August that India had finally gained its freedom from the oppressive and tyrannical British rule."}
{"input": "What happened during that period of time", "target": "I am fascinated in gaining knowledge about all the proceedings that took place in this period, as it’s something I am most curious about. I first came across (found) information about this era in my eighth-grade history book. Since then, I have spoken to my grandparents at length (a long time) on this topic. They have shared stories of freedom fighters standing up against the British army for their rights, apart from many of their own personal accounts (experiences) during that time. Furthermore, I have also read many books and watched various movies and documentaries on this subject to expand my knowledge even more."}
{"input": "Who played an important role in this period of time", "target": "All in all, this era is full of various occurrences on a mass scale and involves sacrifices of innumerable (countless) freedom fighters who gave away everything they had in order to fight the British rule."}
{"input": "And explain why you want to know more about the time period", "target": "In conclusion, it is indeed one of the most essential (important) periods in shaping my country’s history."}
{"input": "Describe a piece of advice you received on your subjects or work", "target": "Well, getting feedback about our performance is simply part of life, whether it be positive or negative. I always thought I was doing all the right things at my job, but the assessment day came and turned out (result) that I wasn’t performing up to par (up to standards). I noticed that since my manager called me to his office and told me to close the door. “I hope this is not that serious” I said, and then he responded “we need to talk”. At that very moment I realized I was doing something wrong at work. My manager started to talk to me about my performance and it was all good but the delivery time of the financial charts were not ideal. He gave me a great advice on how I should manage all the workload I had in order to be able to deliver the financial reports on time."}
{"input": "Describe a situation when you didn't have enough time. You should say: - when it was - where you were - what you tried to do or finish - and explain why you didn't have enough time for it.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I was overwhelmed. I was doing extra hours at work for a co-worker who was ill, so I already had plenty on my plate (to have a lot to do). To add to this, my friend asked me to help her out with an online project of hers, which required a lot of time, energy, and research. Let me give you more details. Well, this was just the other week actually in my hometown. She’s been a long-time friend of mine, so I really wanted to give her a hand, but I simply couldn't manage it. It was a very time-sensitive project, so I didn't want to accept it then later give up. However, she pushed me into it so I ended up doing what I could of it. The thing that really bugged me was that she made it seem like it would be a simple activity, but it required me to research online for several hours, not to mention then writing out documents for about 6 hours each; there were 4 separate assignments. So, in the end, I did one assignment part of it then sent it back to her and told her she would have to make other arrangements. I usually work about 40 hours a week, however, it was over 50 with my extra hours that week, so I simply didn't have much time to spare (extra). Actually, I don't think it would have been possible to add another 24 hours of work onto that week. Furthermore, I have to be energetic at my job to be able to effectively sell new products, so I definitely cannot neglect my sleep schedule. All in all, it was just an inconvenient time!"}
{"input": "Describe a time that you visited a friend", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a special trip I embarked (went) on to see a friend of mine. In October of last year, I went to visit my best friend Michael, who moved to Colorado Springs just a few months before I visited. Visiting Michael was the best excuse to visit a city I always wanted to visit but also to see a dear friend. Let me tell you about this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Colorado Springs is a well-known city for its hot springs, which are wonderful natural hot water springs, ideal for a relaxing afternoon. Besides these, there are snow-capped mountains lining the skyline and endless forests to discover. We spent the weekend snow-shoeing (hiking with special snow shoes) and relaxing at night with a nice hot spring bath. This entire adventure started as soon as I set foot out of the airport there!"}
{"input": "Do you think that it is becoming more difficult to make friends?", "target": "Lately, it is becoming more difficult to make friends and this is caused by social media, even though technology is supposed to connect us in an easier way, it makes it harder to connect face to face. With this said, I feel we are becoming less social, so it’s more challenging to strike up (start) a conversation with a stranger. Although we can stay in better touch with our old friends due to social media, all in all, it has made making lasting friendships harder."}
{"input": "What do you think of making friends on the internet?", "target": "Making friends online could be both good and bad. It all depends on the luck you have and what web pages or apps you use to make friends. For example, when I moved to a new city, I used MeetUp, which led me to find free yoga classes with some of the best people I could ever dream of. So, it can be a hit or miss (a success or a failure)."}
{"input": "\"Describe a historical period you are interested in.\"", "target": "\"I’m going to tell you about the Spanish conquest of the Incas, as I studied Latin American History at University. Simply put, The Incas always left me in awe (amazed). Furthermore, this has always been an important subject to me, because the Incas made groundbreaking (amazing, new) achievements in mathematics, architecture, astronomy, and art. When I analyze (deeply study) the Spanish conquest, I reflect on the Inca’s historical significance, which has persevered despite the loss of the civilization. This has really moved (had an emotional effect) me. Now that you now why I’m fond of (like) this, let me give you a summary of the ins and outs (details) of their story.\""}
{"input": "\"What happened during that period?\"", "target": "\"During this period, between 1532 and 1574, Spanish and Inca nobles brutally (bloody, cruel) fought for dominance in the region. The Spaniards believed that they should rule, and that their moral beliefs were superior to the Incas. The Incas fought to protect their home territory. However, this is a complicated period in history, because many indigenous subjects joined the Spaniards in these battles. They saw red (to be angry) when it came to the the Inca rule. The extra help ultimately led the Spanish to victory.\""}
{"input": "\"Why do you find it interesting?\"", "target": "\"I find this period fascinating because we can learn a lot from it in the present; you can clearly see the correlation (relationship). Many scholars would like to know more about the Inca past, but learn very little because colonial Spanish writings are often dismissive (don’t accept) of Inca technology, and we don’t have Inca writings to help us understand them better. All in all, we learn that there are tragic historical consequences of colonial conquests, and we hope to learn from them in the present.\""}
{"input": "Describe someone you would like to study or work with. You should say: who this person is, how long you have known this person, what you have done together, and why you would like to study or work with this person.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about my friend Veronica. She is the type of friend that you know always has good intentions (kind, means well) and would never do anything to hurt you. Furthermore, she is extremely loyal, understanding, and down to earth (not thinking she is better than others). Even though she is a highly educated and intelligent person, she would never use these qualities to be condescending to another person. We first met back in 2016 in a month-long, intensive Spanish class in Cusco, Peru. The nature of our class there was very open, causing us to share private details about our lives and even embarrassing stories, so this made it easier to get closer as a class. We spent 7 hours a day together in that class, along with about 10 others, so I would say we got to know each other very well. When we broke into (divided) groups, we would often work together which always went well. I felt that she was always a helpful classmate, never one to make you feel dumb for not knowing an answer. After the class, we remained close friends throughout our entire year in Cusco. During that entire time, she never did anything that rubbed me the wrong way (to make angry). With all this said, this is why I would enjoy studying or working with Veronica. I feel that she would always remain sincere, regardless of any cutthroat (bad intentions) workplace environment or competitive or prestigious (of high class) academia. Furthermore, I feel that she would always be there to help me out, and I would never worry that she would be conniving. Lastly, I see that she is a hard-working, dedicated person, so that would make her an even better candidate. Since we already have some experience as classmates and even more as friends, this is why I chose to talk about her."}
{"input": "Describe a place where you read and write (not your home).;", "target": "Well, there is a cabin I like to go every time I feel like writing or reading. It is located up in the North side of West Vancouver. Wonderful place, usually covered by snow throughout the whole year. That sensation of escape and freedom that this cabin gives me, makes me want to write and read. Just being there sitting by the chimney with a cup of chocolate, is one of the most relaxing sensations you ever imagine. I even like to draw a hot bubble bath and read in the tub there, which is truly sublime (unworldly).;"}
{"input": "Is there a completely quiet place?;", "target": "Yes, there are a lot of quiet places, like lakes or mountains, where you can and feel like you are all alone and in the middle of nowhere. Most of these places are located far into remote forests or in the middle of deserts. Actually, I don’t often visit places like this, but I’ve always seen them in films.;"}
{"input": "Is learning a new language important?", "target": "I would definitely say so. I feel that we better ourselves through each language we learn. For example, there is concrete evidence that language strengthens our cognitive (brain) abilities and problem-solving. Since I began my language studies, I feel that my memory has become much stronger and that I’m able to solve puzzles better. Furthermore, I’ve gained a greater understanding of my own native language! Second of all, language creates countless more opportunities for work and travel! Especially with English and Spanish we can travel to a wide range of countries. By being able to expand your customer base, you can achieve more business success. Furthermore, through languages you can discover a new culture, which makes you more open-minded, tolerant, empathetic, adaptable, among other things."}
{"input": "What benefits for one's career does knowledge of foreign languages bring?", "target": "Endless! In this globalizing world, it’s becoming a necessity to know at least one foreign language. Needless to say , English is the language of the world, so this is the most important one to learn to be able to communicate with the entire world. Behind these, I would say that Spanish and Mandarin are extremely useful, as well. By being able to communicate with more of the world’s population, you create opportunities to expand your business. On the other hand, since languages are proven to increase your cognitive functions and puzzle-solving skills, one who speaks more than one language may have stronger problem-solving skills in their career. Furthermore, since many language learners have lived or spent time abroad, they tend to be more adaptable and culturally understanding. All in all, it’s just a win-win (double benefit) to study other languages."}
{"input": "Who do you think learns a language faster, children or adults?", "target": "Definitely children! Since children’s brains are like sponges, absorbing new information, they undoubtedly pick up (learn) languages much faster. Furthermore, children’s memories are much sharper, so it is easier for them to remember new vocabulary. On the other hand, adults are more concrete in their native language and the world they’ve built from it, so they tend to be less open to accept another language. Children, on the other hand, can play games or watch cartoons in another language from a young age and pick up the language without even realizing it. The only advantage that adults have is that their behavior doesn’t stand in the way of their language learning, they are more motivated to learn, and that they are more likely to review and study at home. Furthermore, they pay for the classes, so they are much more invested (care about what they’re doing)!"}
{"input": "Describe a person who has interesting ideas or opinions.", "target": "I’m going to talk about my friend, Elliott, who is a natural (good at) at languages and always has a lot of interesting ideas when it comes to language learning and teaching. He is a fellow teacher at my workplace, so I feel I know him well enough to speak about him. First of all, he is fluent in THREE foreign languages, English, Chinese and Japanese, in addition to his mother tongue. So you can imagine, as a language teacher, he really stands out from the others. I feel that he has a special empathy for language learners. Although he has a knack (a talent) for languages, he knows that others struggle with them, so he always tries to come up with (invent) new methods to help language learners improve faster and achieve better results. In addition to imparting (communicating) knowledge, he always creates a fun atmosphere. For example, at the start of each class, he would have all the students stand up and play some warm-up games instead of going straight into doing routine teaching stuff. Some of the games are even invented by himself and I must say they are all well thought out (well-planned). I learn a lot from observing his classes and look forward to working more with him in the future. I’m really interested in learning more about how to make language learning fun."}
{"input": "What kinds of ideas are respected in your country?", "target": "That’s a tough question, but I’d definitely say any ideas that are groundbreaking (new) or revolutionary are very valued in my country. For example, we really respect people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, who changed future through technology. Furthermore, people who are forward thinkers are respected in today’s society, such as those who search for solutions to violence or support the gay rights movement. Lastly, people really respect those who have innovative business ideas, which improve the country’s economy. Actually, that might be the most respected one. All in all, we like those who are unconventional (unordinary) thinkers."}
{"input": "When do children start to have their own ideas?", "target": "They say that 7 is the “age of reason” (when kids know right from wrong), so I believe this is when it all begins, even if in small ways. I think this is the age where children begin to recognize their individuality and separateness from their parents. However, children tend to follow the belief system of their parents up to their teen years, when they start the rebellious years. Thinking back, I remember I started to question my parent’s religion and political ideas when I was around 15, leading me to break off (separate) from them. So, all in all, by the time you are 18, most teens know who they really are."}
{"input": "Where do these ideas come from?", "target": "The family is definitely the first foundation of how we shape our ideas. Apart from this, I would say teachers have the second largest influence. Following this, what kids hear in school, from their friends, what they watch on TV, and so on start to shape their way of thinking. Lastly, we start to break away (separate) from our family’s ideas and create our own ideas based on our life experiences."}
{"input": "Describe a good experience of online shopping.", "target": "I’m going to talk about a recent successful online shopping experience that I’ve had. To be honest, I’ve had countless incidents in which I ordered the wrong size or the product ended up being completely different than how it appeared online, so I was surprisingly delighted with this purchase. Well, let me tell you about it. Zara is my favorite store, and unfortunately there isn’t one currently near my house, so I decided to check out their online shopping site. I just started a professional job, so I’m always in need for more professional clothes. Zara always seems to fit me well and have classy, smart clothes, so I decided I would order a white dress from them. Luckily, the dress was on sale for"}
{"input": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping?", "target": "The advantages would be that it’s more convenient and saves loads of time, avoiding those dreaded lines. Furthermore, sites like Amazon tend to have secondhand items, so you can save a lot of money this way. The negatives are that you cannot try clothing on before, sometimes items don’t look the same in person, the shipping fees, and the time you have to wait for the item. By the same token, it’s a hassle to send it back if there’s an issue. So, all in all, there are more disadvantages, I’d say."}
{"input": "Do you think it is safe to shop online?", "target": "Depends on the site. If you use a reputable one like Amazon or the store’s website, it is generally very safe. However, buying from private sellers online, especially in their homes, can be risky. Furthermore, scams always exist online, so you never know if someone could be scamming you. I always say, if you have time, it’s better to go buy the item in person to gain more trust in the purchase."}
{"input": "Do you think the government should impose more control on online shopping?", "target": "Wow, this isn’t something I’ve ever thought about. In my opinion, I think the government should investigate to make sure sites are reputable, but that’s about all. I don’t think there should be any limit to what we buy, as long as they are legal products. Every purchase benefits the economy, so at this point I don’t see a need to regulate it."}
{"input": "Describe a singer that you like.", "target": "I would like to talk about one of my favorite singers, Sam Smith. He is a British singer and songwriter who has become popular in my lifetime. He is famed for his mellifluous (containing flow) voice and quality of his song lyrics, which are often romantic and soulful. Thinking back, I remember the first song I heard from him was “Latch”， circa I remember my roommate was playing it in her car and I asked who the singer was and decided to look him up. Ever since that day, I just fell in love with him. He constantly has new hits out on the pop radio stations! His songs are just super catchy (something you remember). I would consider his music to be a mix of soul and pop. I think he started as a soul singer, but his music has transformed into being more of a pop genre. I really like his music because there is always a good beat to it, and the lyrics speak to me on a deep level, causing me to feel emotional and identify with current dilemmas(problems) I’m facing. I like that some of his songs are more for dancing, while others are more deep and romantic. All in all, he is extremely talented and has a wide range. Sam Smith has a voice that really leaves a mark on you (impressive). I just love him!"}
{"input": "What kinds of music are popular in your country?", "target": "A wide range! Nowadays with youngsters, EDM music is all the rage (popular). Besides that, pop music, hip hop, alternative, and country are types of music that you hear most often on the radio. For example, my parents’ generations still sticks with their southern rock style of music, such as ACDC. Of all the music from the past, 80’s American music seems to be played on the radio the most often."}
{"input": "Do singers make lots of money?", "target": "Of course! Singers are some of the richest people in the world. However, I imagine that their pay may be cut due to the increase in Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, and the like instead of buying the records at stores. However, our generation idolizes (worships) celebrities, so they make incomparable profits from their social media posts, concerts, and just pure talent."}
{"input": "What do you think makes a song become popular?", "target": "Definitely by how catchy it is, for one. Also, how well the artist markets themselves. If they constantly get their songs into the Top 40, their songs will be heard by the entire world. Lastly, of course, the artist needs to talented and have something that makes their songs stand out (be unique) from the others, such as by having a lovely voice, good beat, etc."}
{"input": "Describe a time that you invited family or friends to have dinner at home or in a restaurant.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I invited my parents and grandparents over to my house for tortellini soup. I had just moved into my new house, so I was really excited for this housewarming event. Actually, I was extra excited because I just moved near my relatives after living across the country for years. I planned this event myself because I felt confident in my ability of making tortellini soup. Along with the soup, I prepared an Italian style salad and some warm, homemade bread with it. My mom passed the recipe down to me, so I had years of experience preparing it. I know it’s always a hit at social events! During the meal, we talked about memories of my mother, who had passed away 10 years before. Every time we eat her recipe, it always brings back memories of her. After that, we had small talk about our weekly plans and updates in our lives. Furthermore, my family asks me lots of questions about what home improvement plans I had for my new home, so I showed them the furniture and paint colors I had chosen for the house. We drank Pinot Grigio wine during the meal, which paired well with the Italian flavors. We met to catch up and enjoy my new home together. It was a simple yet very pleasant dinner party!"}
{"input": "Do people in your country prefer to eat at home or in restaurants?", "target": "Since I’m from a low-income country, people tend to eat at home rather than at restaurants to economize. Furthermore, the family is very central in my country, so all of the family members come together with the ingredients they have to cook a grand meal together on the daily. When we all pitch it, we all end up saving money and enjoying a higher quality meal than we would get at a restaurant."}
{"input": "What do people usually cook for special festivals?", "target": "Although seemingly strange or unappealing to others, guinea pigs are a delicacy in my country. For the Festival of the Sun in June every year, we prepare the guinea pig called “Cuy” and eat it home with our families, and even sell it on the streets. Sometimes we also prepare a cold dish called “Chiriuchu” which consists of chicken, guinea pig, fish eggs, and seaweed eaten cold. Still, I understand it doesn’t sound tasty to others, but I’m very fond it of it."}
{"input": "What would you say are the benefits and drawbacks of eating in a restaurant?", "target": "The benefits are that it is easier, more convenient, less work, and that you are able to try more international dishes whose ingredients you may never get to get your hands on. Also, at a restaurant, they often have interesting cocktails and appetizers to try with your meal. However, the disadvantages are that it’s more expensive, you tend to consume larger portions and more calories, and that you don’t know the real source of your food. In my opinion, it isn’t healthy to constantly eat at restaurants. They should be reserved for special occasions, if you want to try a specific food that you don’t know how to prepare, or if you’re in a pinch for time."}
{"input": "More and more people are having their meals delivered, so would people cook at home?", "target": "With the food delivery apps of today, I can see that less people are eating at home. In countries like America where fast food is cheaper than home-cooked meals, I can definitely see how people would choose that option over cooking at home. However, in my country, fast food is very expensive, so people cannot afford to eat out very often. Since we have ample markets with fresh, delicious ingredients available to us, it is not common to go out for meals other than for special occasions."}
{"input": "Describe an occasion you got up early in the morning.", "target": "To be honest, I was rarely out of bed by 8.00 AM apart from some specific occasions. However, there is an occasion I had to wake up earlier than usual which is my trip to ABC last summer vacation. I was supposed to get everything prepared the night before, so I did pack my suitcases with all the essential items that I might need for my vacation trip, like suntan cream or some swimming costumes. When the preparation was over, I try to send myself to sleep but ended up tossing and turning in bed, so you see, I hardly got a wink of sleep. When the dawn came, I went out to feel the gentle touch of a cool breeze on my face, then I also took a sip of coffee to get myself fully awake. After some minutes, the coach showed up and I got in no time. I took the trip with 2 of my besties, so we had the chance to catch up on gossip with one another. We also had fun at many outdoor activities on the beach like surfing. Although I was a bit exhausted at the end of the journey due to lack of sleep, it was definitely an enjoyable time. Since then, I have been less of a night owl and got up earlier, which I think is a better and healthier habit."}
{"input": "Do people in your country like naps?", "target": "Frankly speaking, the majority of people in my country seem to like taking a siesta in the afternoon. Understandably, it has been a proven fact that a short nap can recharge people’s batteries after an arduous morning working or studying. Having said that, some of my friends, for instance, aren't in the habit of taking such a short rest as they think a cup of coffee can do the trick and they’d rather save that time to complete their outstanding tasks at hand."}
{"input": "What time is better for teenagers to study, in the morning or at night?", "target": "Personally, I’d pick study in the morning simply because teenagers can have better concentration span. Specifically, after a night's rest, your body fully recovers and your minds are more refreshed, which can be conducive to the acquisition of knowledge. By contrast, after a backbreaking day at school or work, most teenagers often become lazy or sleepy, at this time what they wish to do is go to sleep right off the bat."}
{"input": "Why do people always say it’s healthy to eat breakfast?", "target": "Without a shadow of a doubt, breakfast is of great importance if we expect to have a productive day of working or studying. After a long night's rest, the body extremely needs energy which can be met by a supply of nutrients from a sumptuous breakfast. Also at this time of the day, the body's absorption rate is highest which means that the foods consumed would be digested properly and absorbed quickly into the body and turned into energy for the next working period."}
{"input": "Will working late at night influence the next day's work?", "target": "Absolutely yes. If you are being pressurized by a backbreaking deadline and have to burn the midnight oil completing it in time, the chances are that you will feel completely fatigued and lose your appetite the next working day. This is simply because a good sleep is important for your body to recover from exhaustion. What I mean here is that it's better if you turn in early and wake up earlier than being a night owl and lie in the next morning."}
{"input": "Describe a practical skill you learnt.", "target": "In my country, buying a car isn’t exactly a big deal, but driving a car is. It sounds a bit odd, doesn’t it? Well, if it does, then the reason for this is, it is extremely difficult to obtain a driving license in my country as it involves some rigorous driving and road tests. So, when I finally managed to pass the driving test a year ago or so, I felt as if I had landed on the moon. I had recently gone to a job interview in which they required the candidate to have their driver’s license. I was really intrigued by the job, so I decided to follow up on this. So, I went to a local car driving school and started to take driving lessons mostly on the weekends, as I worked during the week. Initially, the lessons involved learning about different parts of a car and their functions. Then came the actual driving lessons on the road by understanding and following different road signs and driving rules. Needless to say, the lessons followed some stringent driving standards which weren’t always easy to maintain, but that was exactly the real “test” in order to help a future driver understand the safety and security aspects of taking a car on the roads. Anyway, the lessons had continued for almost three months, and I was finally ready to take an official driving test to obtain a driver’s license. Anyway, I am glad that I had finally learned driving as it has allowed me the freedom to travel to my work and other places at my own pace and according to my agenda. Besides, learning this driving skill has also made me confident about applying for some well-paying jobs. Finally, learning how to drive has also allowed me to transport many bulky items in my car, which otherwise would have been really inconvenient for me if I had to take them on the bus like before. All in all, driving is just so useful."}
{"input": "Describe a time you visited a place with friends.", "target": "Well, I spend my spare (extra) time with my friends quite often. I'd especially like to talk about a time my friends and I traveled to Thailand after graduating medical school. After all those years of blood, sweat, and tears, we really deserved this trip. I vividly remember this moment because as soon as we got out of our final exams, we were all aboard on the way to Bangkok. 6 of us had originally agreed upon going, but finally 2 bailed at the last minute. When I think about it, it was an experience to bond more with just this small group. The main reason for visiting there was to get away from the stress gained from studying very hard. Speaking of what we did there, it was pure relaxation and discovery. We saw everything from the majestic pagodas and kingdoms in Bangkok to the pristine, white-sanded beaches in the Phi Phi Islands. Even more than just the incredible landscapes, the kind-hearted, welcoming people were what really left their mark on us. To sum up, we truly had a blast on this trip. It was really what we needed at the time! I’ll never forget the flavors of pad thai and bubble tea! It was 100% a blast."}
{"input": "Describe the information that was incorrect that you got.", "target": "Well, wrong information creates many difficulties in our lives. Sometimes we have to face danger due faulty (incorrect) details. So, here I would like to talk about a time when I got the wrong information from a website. About 3 years ago, my friend sent me an email with an attached link to something. He wrote me that it is a link to a website where there is an article related to a painting competition. I clicked on that link and a website was opened on my laptop’s screen within a few seconds. I read a piece of information related to a painting competition at the district level. It was going to organize an art gallery in my district, and it was necessary to register for it. So, I registered for this competition because I can paint a variety of paintings. The fee for this painting contest was about 50 dollars, so I paid it with my credit card. The competition would occur in ten days. I started my preparations for performing better in this competition. On the day of the competition, I went to Moga via bus and I arrived there at 8.00 A.M. I visited the correct place because I had received the venue from the website. I entered an art gallery named “Street Art”. I asked about this painting competition to reception. The receptionist told me that there would be competition held, even though I showed them a receipt which I got during registration. To add to it, He explained to me that there was an error on their ad regarding the date, and that he would do what he could to help me out. He apologized to me for this inconvenience, but I still couldn’t help but feel so disappointed. All in all, after that moment, I came back home. Now you see, wrong information causes inconveniences."}
{"input": "Would you say people trust the information that is found online?", "target": "In this day and age, people tend to believe everything they read online without even questioning it first. This is dangerous, as people sometimes write whatever they want online. Before we determine that information is trustworthy, we must consider the source. I think information can be trusted from sites with a .org/.edu at the end of it, as well as photographs for extra proof. For example, one safety precaution is to never go directly to someones’s house from the internet. It’s always better to meet at a public place first."}
{"input": "How can people check whether a piece of information is correct or not?", "target": "There are various means that can help people tell the right information from the wrong one. The first approach is to gain access to reliable sources of information, and make a comparison with the fraudulent information to see the differences. Dependable sources of news can be established newspapers like BBC, the New York Times and other verified news agencies. The second method is that people can ask for advice of professionals in the field, either by phone or email, and wait for some days to receive their feedback."}
{"input": "What are the most common ways in which people obtain information?", "target": "I think people obtain the larger share of their information from books and mass media like TV, newspapers and radio. And today since the Internet has grown exponentially, more and more people are getting their information from the web. There is an eclectic mix of stuff that those who go online can take advantage from, such as newsfeeds on social networking websites like Facebook, or informative contents from other electronic news platforms."}
{"input": "Describe a time when someone didn't tell you the whole truth about something.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I was really upset about someone lying to me. As I whole-heartedly value the truth, I feel very disappointed when I find out that someone has lied to me, especially when it’s someone close to me. So, I'll share this situation with you. I had just started dating a new guy and felt that I really liked him. I was 24 at the time, and he had said that he was 30. He appeared to be a bit older than that, so I tried to clarify his age twice, which he insisted was exactly 30. So, I decided to believe him. I was chatting with his best friend one day who was 32, and he made a comment saying that he was younger than Manny, which I was confused about at first. Later that day, I called Manny out (confronted) about that over text, in which after several lies finally confessed that he was actually 33 years old. I knew it wasn’t the most terrible lie someone could tell, but I felt that my trust in him was tested. I thought, “if someone lies about simple personal details, what else do they lie about?” He never stated his intentions about his lie, but I would imagine that maybe he felt he was too old for me. I guess that he was afraid to lose me if I knew he was 33, which wasn't a problem for me. Furthermore, maybe he was struggling with accepting his age himself, so he wanted to keep believing that he was 30. I’m sure it was related to his insecurities one way or another. Anyway, whatever his reasons were, I decided to give him another chance although I wasn't happy that he was dishonest."}
{"input": "Describe a person who helps others in his spare time.", "target": "I would like to talk about my co-worker, John, who is always willing to go the extra mile for others. As teachers, we constantly have a lot to do outside of the classroom. However, John utilizes his free time to be of service to others. For example, he sends his students extra materials every single day, always stays overtime to assist other co-workers, and even stops by work outside of work hours to bring us snacks. Whenever an emergency situation arises, he is always the first one to lend a hand. I believe he does this because he is a man of faith. Besides this, I think that people improve their well-being when they dedicate themselves to others. To him, it is no sweat to be of service to others- it’s simply a joy. I truly value John, as he is a rare breed. In this day and age, it’s uncommon to find someone who simply wants to do good without ulterior motives. I can say with full confidence that John isn’t looking for anything in return. All in all, John is just an excellent human being."}
{"input": "Describe a park or garden you visited and liked.", "target": "As a citizen in a metropolitan city, I am usually partial to choosing fresh outing spaces for relaxation after being up to my neck in work. Although there are many beautiful places in London, I would like to mention one in particular- Hyde Park. It’s a must-see for tourists. In the center of the hustle and bustle of London, Hyde Park is a beautiful oasis of trees, open space, and flowers. It’s a place where people go to have picnics, take a stroll, catch a breath of fresh air, etc. Well, my cousin and I went there for a jog on Sunday morning. Even though we are not morning people, we decided to push through to do this, and we are so glad! We jogged around the entire park which is approximately 5 kilometers, then we laid out some blankets and rested there among the greenery. It was the perfect way to recharge for the week. I really enjoyed this because it was an escape from city life. The work culture in London is demanding, so it’s nice to catch a break from time to time. Since I’m a salaried worker, I tend to spend over 40 hours working per week. I crave moments in nature after being confined to my desk all week. Furthermore, when I exercise, I find that I disconnect from the stress in my life and reduce it. All in all, it was a much needed day to escape our obligations!"}
{"input": "Describe a time you taught something new to a younger person", "target": "Well, since I’m a teacher, I teach new things to younger people on a daily basis. However, I will highlight one experience in particular that was really rewarding (gave me a personal benefit) to me. This would be when I taught a 4 year old student how to hold a pencil correctly and begin to write her first letters. Thinking back, this was about 2 years ago now. I usually teach high-school aged kids, but in this particular time I decided to take on a summer school program with 4-5 year old students. This girl who I taught to write was 4 years old, while the others were 5 years old, already having experience in kindergarten. I planned a lesson on the alphabet, assuming that all of them had previous knowledge of this. However, I had to sit beside the 4 year old girl to further assist her as she didn't have previous knowledge of this. We started off by holding the pencil together to form the letters, followed by me slowly easing (taking off easily) my hand off of it. I stayed beside her until she was able to write out her first letters. I’ll never forget the excited look on her face when she finally got the hang of it! As the class progressed, she was easily able to keep up (stay at the same speed as) with the 5 year olds. This was an extremely rewarding experience for me; I was just so excited. Since I had never experienced teaching a child a basic skill, it was really special to me. It made me start to think about raising my own family one day, especially standing beside my children at their milestones (big life events). I had never thought about how exciting it must be to be a parent! All in all, it was an emotional moment for me."}
{"input": "Describe a historical building you have visited.", "target": "I’m going to talk about the majestic Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca city tucked into (inside) the Andes Mountain range. More than 7,000 feet above sea level, Machu Picchu is the most visited tourist destination in Peru. A symbol of the Incan Empire and built around 1450AD, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007! It was such a humbling experience! I had always seen pictures of Machu Picchu and studied about its significance in school, but experiencing it in person made me realize that the pictures do it absolutely no justice (looks better in person). Upon arrival, you start to see intricate stone paths, walls, and buildings surrounded by mountain ranges, which frame the ancient city. There are irrigation systems and farming terraces extending down the mountains. Below it, there is fast-flowing river. You can tell they built this city intelligently! Furthermore, there are llamas throughout the structure, as well as tourists posing for selfies in every direction. The contrast between the bright green mountains with the stone city and agricultural terraces is truly breath-taking. On sunny days, you can see snow-capped mountain ranges even further in the distance! In this incredible place, I did a tour to learn about the history of the Incas and the detailed work and planning that went into building this place. For example, I learned that they suppose Machu Picchu was built to house the aristocratic class and that it was abandoned after the Spanish conquest. Furthermore, I learned that the Incas worshiped the sun, and that they had technology way ahead of their time (advanced), which reflects in their stonework, irrigation system, farming system, etc. As I had always been fascinated by the Incas, I decided to take this trip with my family to see it in person. I’m so glad I did! What a magnificent place it was."}
{"input": "Do people in your country often visit historical buildings?", "target": "To be honest, not really. As the US is a very new country, there aren’t many historical places to visit. Furthermore, since people tend to enjoy visiting the coast or modern places more, historical places are losing their value. Moreover, people usually only have a week of paid vacation per year, so they tend to visit family or take a family beach, camping, or mountain trip instead. Unfortunately, not too many people have the means, desire, nor the time to visit historical monuments."}
{"input": "Do children like to go to that kind of place?", "target": "I definitely think a child would be impressed by the sight of Machu Picchu, but I don’t like it would be the number one spot to take them. For example, there are steep drop-offs (steep hills) where a child could easily fall to their death. Secondly, it may be tiring for children to walk up the steep steps, and they could get bored during the several hour tour. On the other hand, I think children would get a kick out of (be entertained by) the llamas walking around the complex!"}
{"input": "Do you think people who damage historical relics should be put in prison?", "target": "Yes, in most cases! It is just insane that someone would do such a thing. I think this is such a heinous (horrible) crime for someone to destroy a piece of history. A person who would do such a terrible thing clearly doesn’t understand the value of historical relics. However, before putting the person in jail, authorities should determine the reason for it. Perhaps the person would do such a thing as a way to seek vengeance (revenge) for a historical event that deeply scarred them. Still, it is unacceptable for them to destroy it, but maybe the government should consider what historical landmarks mean to some."}
{"input": "Describe something a child did that made you laugh.", "target": "Often, children say and do the craziest things, as they lack the filter that adults have! It leads to lots of laughter. So, let me tell you about this child, Peter, who really made me laugh. He the child of one of my co-workers. It was Peter’s 3rd birthday party last week and I attended his birthday party. As I know Peter is a very active, rambunctious (naughty) child, I thought a water gun would be a suitable gift for him. So, I presented it to him and he was ecstatic (excited)! Peter sees many television shows and knows that the guns are used to shoot. So, he immediately started playing with the gun. He refilled the gun with water and pointed it to the guests and shot them with water! He wanted to have fun and did so. But finally, when the water ran out (emptied) and his parents did not allow him to refill with water, he shot them. When he shot his dad, the dad fell on the ground. When he shot his mother, she also fell in the ground as if she died. He was surprised. He could not decide what to do. So, he shot himself and fell beside his mother until they stopped pretending to be dead. The entire event was hilarious (really funny), and all of the guests were roaring in laughter. In fact, the kid was highly clever and his gestures made me laugh. He was confused what to do when he shot his parents. So, finding no other options left, he killed himself. In fact, it proves his guilt but the representation of the situation was really interesting that everyone could not stop laughing with this scenario. Despite the issue being a serious one, it was a kind of comical event. So, I laughed with my whole heart. In fact, it was the rapid decision making skill of the child and the implementation of the decision without any hesitation was the key element of the genuine laughter."}

{"input": "\"Describe a person you wanted to be similar to when you were growing up.\"", "target": "\"Today I’ll tell you about how I used to want to be like my sister when I was younger. She was always the popular, scholarly type, while I was sort of the unfocused, social outcast (unpopular) type. I always struggled with my weight when I was younger even though I ate pretty healthily, whereas my sister always had a perfect, thin physique (fitness) even while eating junk food constantly. My sister is 2 years older than me, and we grew up together. She was always at the top of her class, even though she studied very little. I remember her saying that she would forget to study, but still get nearly 100% on her exams, even through her college years. Moreover, she had a natural athletic ability with very little effort. She could take up a new sport and be good at it at the drop of a hat! I envied her swimming and basketball skills, especially. Apart from this, she was the thin, pretty blonde girl that everyone wanted to be friends with, although she didn't have to put effort into being nice to people. Another thing I looked up to her for was that it was easy for her to speak her mind. When I was younger especially, I always found it difficult to speak up even when I was being treated unfairly. Reflecting back, I think what I most wished to inherit from her was her ability to do everything at ease. It seems like I always had to put more effort into school to get good grades, be fit, have friends, etc, so I wished those things could come easier. I especially wished I had her athletic ability, as I would like to do more physical activity. Furthermore, I wish I didn't have to spend countless hours studying and even meeting with a tutor to get good grades. However, as I’ve gotten older, I realize that we cannot compare ourselves to other people because we all have different strengths and weaknesses. Still, I admire her for her abilities as well as her outspokenness.\""}
{"input": "Describe a quiz program or game show on TV. You should say: What it is, When you watch it, What it is about, And explain how you feel about the program.", "target": "I’m going to talk about a quiz show called “Who wants to be millionaire?”. As it famous all over the globe, I’m sure you’ve heard of it before. It can be viewed by everyone, as it is family friendly. Well, let me tell you how it works. At the start of the show, the contestants gather and prepare to answer a multiple choice question to decide who gets to be in the “hot seat”. Naturally, it’s the person who answers accurately within the shortest time frame. When a contestant is selected, he or she will proceed to sit in a chair in the center and have the opportunity to answer a total of 15 questions that become progressively more difficult. For every answer that you answer correctly, you are awarded a determined amount of money. Apparently, if you’re unsure of one particular question, you can always stop the game and go home with the money that you have allotted at that time. However, if you are willing to take your chances, you can follow your instinct and keep going. Also, there are always three “aids” you can use, for example you can call your friends for help, or choose to have half of the options eliminated. All in all, I enjoy this game because it’s very suspenseful: it always keeps me on the edge of my seat! Furthermore, I gain knowledge from watching this show. Since I have 2 teenage children, I like that it is something that we can all watch together!"}
{"input": "Do people in your country like to watch TV?", "target": "Too much! People in my country are definitely couch potatoes (people who like to stay on the sofa all day). Since it’s always rainy here, people tend to stay indoors and watch Netflix quite often. With a raging entertainment industry, there is always some hot new TV series coming out, which leaves people on the edge of their seats (anxious; excited)."}
{"input": "What games do children play nowadays?", "target": "In this technological world, children are shifting more towards video games, as well as games on their cell phones or tables. Actually, I was shocked the other day when I walked past a group of elementary kids who were all simultaneously staring away at their cell phones, lost in their games. I always get on (push) my children to go outside and take a bike ride or a walk instead of staring at their X-box all evening long."}
{"input": "Are there any differences between the games children's games and adults' games?", "target": "Yes, to an extent. First of all, kids tend to have more energy, so they like games like tag where they can run around like crazy. Furthermore, kid’s games are usually more cartoon character based games, or educational games that work on building soft skills. Since adults already have these skills, their games are usually based on creativity or a higher intelligence level. However, there are many similarities of all games, considering most are based on entertainment and problem-solving skills."}
{"input": "Describe a regular thing you do every day.", "target": "Since the start of 2019, I promised myself to exercise more to lead a healthy lifestyle. So far so good! Let me tell you about my usual workout routine. Well, luckily my apartment complex has a fitness center, so I use this gym the most often, as it’s extremely convenient. Additionally, I have a gym membership at another fitness club, as well as exercise outdoors on days with pleasant weather. When I go to the gym, I usually spend 30-60 minutes doing cardio, in which I alternate between the bicycle, treadmill, and elliptical. After this, I move on to some light weight-lifting to help tone my body. For example, I do some triceps (muscle in your arms) exercises to thin out my arms, or some crunches (abdomen exercise) to harden up my abs (abdominals). So, between the cardio and weight lifting, I spend about an hour and fifteen minutes at the gym per day. I do this because it benefits my mental and physical health. Exercise releases endorphins (a brain chemical), which cause you to feel happier. Furthermore, I feel more confident when I work out. Also, I feel that I have more leeway (freedom) on what I can eat when I exercise, as I’m known for having a sweet tooth (likes sweet food). Lastly, I’ve been wanting to shed (lose) some extra pounds, so exercise definitely aids in this. All in all, there’s no way to argue that exercising is loaded (full) with benefits!"}
{"input": "Describe a product or application which is based on artificial intelligence.", "target": "Artificial intelligence, the latest front in computer science, is affecting all fields of technology, continually making our lives easier. Nowadays there are countless (many) apps and products in existence thanks to artificial intelligence, but I would like to talk about one I’m especially fond of (like), which is the robot vacuum cleaner, especially the Samsung powerbot. I’ve always been a bad sweeper, so this is an ideal creation for me. I was gifted one for Christmas last year and I’ve been in love with it ever since! Instead of sweeping the floors, the robot vacuums are battery operated machines which go all over your house to pick up all the dirt, animal fur, and dust for you! All you have to do is put batteries in them and empty them out after they do their rounds (go around). You can even program it to sweep the floors at a specific time daily! The interesting thing about them is that they remember the map of the room and have a sensor to know when they are approaching another object, and then turn away. Furthermore, they sense when they have sufficiently cleaned the floors then return back to their charging station home-base. I think this is such a brilliant invention, as I usually miss dirt when I sweep the floors myself. Although it’s pricey, about $300 per machine, I believe it’s worth it for the time and efficiently of it. Since a lot of people track dirt into the house when they enter, this is a sure way to keep the floors constantly clean and tidy. All in all, I’m a huge fan of it (I really like it)!"}
{"input": "Can Artificial Intelligence be conscious?", "target": "Mmm...not really. I know they are programmed to sense when someone is near them or enters the room, but I’m unsure of whether they are really conscious. For example, with more advanced robots such as Erica, I do believe she has feelings and her individual personality. Furthermore, I know she has a very developed “brain”. On the other hand， I know that Alexa or Siri don’t have a conscious. They simply respond with a series of programmed responses. Perhaps it’s just my own bias (preference), but I’m firm in the fact that I don’t believe that robots’ emotions could never match humans’."}
{"input": "How does AI help us in everyday life?", "target": "Alexa helps us to check the weather, save electricity by turning the lights off when we leave the room, remembers our favorite playlists, etc. More than anything else, she reduces the amount of monotonous (boring and repetitive) tasks we are used to doing and makes our lives easier. I believe there are more benefits than drawbacks to her presence. On the other hand, we shouldn’t rely too heavily on Al, since technology can fail us at any given second."}
{"input": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of AI?", "target": "I would say the advantages are that it saves time, reminds us to conserve electricity, makes listening to music easier, provides easier navigating, and is simply rather amusing. On the other hand, I don’t think there are any drawbacks (disadvantages) to her except the fact that people become to reliant on technology and tend to get irrate when it fails them. For example, I always go to my friend’s house and when Alexa can’t understand what he said, he will start to holler at her! I think people build too high of expectations for technology, assuming it should be just as intelligent as a human, which causes people to lose their tempers (get angry)."}
{"input": "Describe a prize you want to get.", "target": "The prize I would like to get is from a quiz show called “Who wants to be millionaire?”， known all of the world. I’m sure you are familiar with this, so it’s unnecessary to explain every detail of how it works. So, I’ll describe it briefly. It is roughly like this, contestants have to answer in total 15 questions that get increasingly more difficult. For every answer that you get right, you’ll be awarded a determined amount of money. Apparently if you’re not sure about one particular question, you can always stop the game and go home with the money. But if you’re feeling adventurous you can just go with your instinct. And there’s always three “aids” you can use, for example you can call your friends for help, or choose to have half of the options eliminated. Winning first prize, which means nailing (getting correct) all 15 questions, is what I’m aiming for. The game requires you to know a bit of everything, so I’m reading up on areas that I’m not interested in or familiar with. I’m also looking for people who I can call for help during the program. I’m planning on entering the competition next month!"}
{"input": "Is it good to have competition?", "target": "I think competition is healthy to an extent. But, I think the number one person we should compete with is always ourselves. Being better than we previously were is the number one priority, in my opinion. However, team and individual competitions are also a healthy and necessary way to motivate people to try their hardest and gain a sense of teamwork and sportsmanship (respect to the other team whether you win or lose). By the same taken, failure is also a great lesson to help us to be better in the future. We all need failure just as much as we need success!"}
{"input": "Do you think it's good to award prizes in school and university?", "target": "Yes, I believe so. By setting a prize, we give the students incentive to learn and try their hardest. Awards like Student of the Month, Perfect Attendance Awards, Dean’s List, etc. are something that boosts the confidence of the student, and may even benefit their future when they add these achievements onto their CVs. Furthermore, while school can be a dry, dull place, adding competitions adds a level of entertainment, which makes it a more fun environment. Moreover, even if a student loses a competition, that failure can be transformed into a positive lesson down the road (in the future). Of course there are always some students and parents who take it too far, but all in all, it is a healthy and much needed practice in the school system."}
{"input": "Do you think companies should give their employees prizes?", "target": "Definitely! Awards like Employee of the Month, promotions, and so on motivate employees to give their best in their jobs. If employees always give 100% and never receive anything in return, they may feel that there is no incentive to work hard. For those who are naturally competitive, this is a necessity to them. Of course some employees may become jealous or resentful (hateful) of others, but it is also a motivating factor to build a sense of sportmanship and will make them want to work even harder the next time around."}
{"input": "How to reward successful people?", "target": "Truth be told, rewards for successful people should come in plenty of forms. If they make an enormous contribution to the nation, then they should be given proper publicity. For example, a veteran who fought bravely or a hero who sacrificed their life for the peace of a country should be remembered forever in sculptures and paintings. On the other hand, successful businesspeople who play a significant role in the development of their nation’s economy should be awarded with medals or certifications so as to stimulate them to make even greater contributions in the future."}
{"input": "Should schools establish awards? What rewards can children get from school?", "target": "From what I see, I guess it is quite well-advised for schools to have a reward system to encourage good deeds and academic performance amongst students. Students would be a helpful citizen if schools add extra points to their academic record for talking an elder across the street, offering to lift a heavy object for a passerby on the street, for example. On top of that, academically poor students can feel the motivation to strive further in their studies to reap the rewards, like they can obtain some pocket money for being the top student in the class during a semester. This can greatly spur their scholastic progress."}
{"input": "Should parents push their children to get prizes?", "target": "Children are at an impressionable age, so adults can interfere in their ways of thinking. Some measures can be adopted to change children’s mindset, and one is by raising their awareness via realistic and practical action. Parents can show their kids that they can do rapid calculations if they learn math properly at school, or they can sing well when they grow up if they don’t skip music classes."}
{"input": "What do you think employers can do to help motivate their employees to perform better at work, besides giving them a pay raise?", "target": "There is a number of ways that bosses or supervisors can adopt to raise their employees’ morale and enhance the overall work productivity apart from offering them higher salary. I guess the most effective approach would be for companies to organize annual excursions so that their workers can socialize with one another and cultivate team spirit while they can escape from the stress for a while. The second one is that more a flexible working schedule should be brought in, because this would allow workers to have more quality family time and a worry-free set of mind at work."}
{"input": "Describe an important technological product you bought.", "target": "I consider myself lucky to have a job in a multinational company, which caused me to buy a laptop for my ordinary use at home. I’m very satisfied with this purchase, so I would love to share the story. Well, let me give you some background. I am the eldest daughter of my family and live with them here in India. I recently got a job which requires me to complete digital tasks online. Besides, it has become impossible for me to use the internet with my old cell phone. Considering everything, I have bought a laptop from the Dell brand shop online. Though I saved a portion of money from sources like private tuition for the laptop for a long time, the best opportunity came when I got appointed to this multinational company. I added the remaining from my salary and brought the laptop home. This is the age of technology and using the internet with mobile phones is not very efficient. Someone may browse the internet or social networking websites temporarily on a mobile network, but that is not suitable for any large scale jobs. Often I have to perform some official tasks using the internet and this is almost impossible by using the cell phone. Besides, I like watching movies for recreational purposes and my cell phone is unable to come with such support for me. Moreover, my parents are devoutly religious and love listening to guided prayers on there. Considering all such matters, I decided to get a laptop but unfortunately could not manage the entire amount. So, when I received my paycheck, I bought it right away! I bought the laptop last month and have been using for around three weeks. By this time, the laptop has proved its worth. It holds an outstanding charge-usually about 7 hours. Besides, my parents are also using it and they are happy too. I planned to use the internet modem but my father has arranged a broadband internet connection. So, using the internet is no longer a problem for us. I have two younger sisters and they are also careful about using the laptop. They mostly use the laptop when I am not home and watch cartoons and animated movies on the internet. My mother takes care of the laptop and she is responsible for keeping it safe and clean from dust. I was really happy to buy this laptop. It may sound strange to some that it was a dream for me. I have realized the necessity of a laptop when I was at my university. I was unable to complete projects and assignments. I had to rely (depend) on my friends who had their own laptops. Though they cordially allowed me to use their laptops, I felt uncomfortable most of the time. On the other side, my family was not fortunate enough to spend some extra bucks(dollars) for me to buy a laptop. So, I made a plan to make this dream come true. After lots of struggles, I got the job and finally have my own laptop. All in all, I couldn’t live without it now!"}
{"input": "How much has technology improved how we communicate with each other?", "target": "This is a controversial (debatable) topic. On one hand, communication had opened up endless windows of opportunities to reach a broader spectrum (range) of people, keep in touch (contact) with people better, and just all in all made communication more accessible. For example, I lived across the world, but I still felt close to my family, thanks to FaceTime. On the other hand, I believe it has had a negative effect on how we communicate with others. Where in the past we used to value discussing matters at face value, we now hide behind computer screens. I even feel I am scared to confront people face to face when I could make it easier over the phone or via text message/email. All in all, there are positives and negatives to it."}
{"input": "Do you agree that there are still many more major technological innovations to be made?", "target": "Of course! Endless, actually. There is more that will be created than we can even imagine at this particular moment in time. Looking back, I could never have dreamt in my wildest dreams all that is accessible to us nowadays. I’m anxious to see what will be available to us in the future! I can imagine hologram (digital) image video chats!"}
{"input": "Do you think people rely too much on technology?", "target": "At times! I think people are becoming incapable of doing things the old school way, and with that said losing real skill. For example, I am a teacher and we rely so heavily on videos, smartboards, audio files, etc, that when technology fails us, we are completely lost. Furthermore, I must be connected to my phone, email, and text messages at all times to even function. Moreover, I see that children are starting to not be able to enjoy life without a tablet or phone, whereas kids enjoyed playing outside and getting dirty in the past. So yes, in this world where a wifi connection can fail us in an instant, people often rely too heavily on it."}
{"input": "Could you suggest some reasons why some people are deciding to reduce their use of technology?", "target": "I’m seeing that people are starting to realize that they can’t enjoy the moment they are in because they are always glued to(attached to) their phones. Furthermore, they want to reduce the amount of time they stare at at a computer screen all day, as it is straining and damaging to our eyes. Moreover, parents want to try to manage the time their kids spent playing video games, encouraging them to get more fresh air. With the app that records the amount of time that you spent on social media a day, it’s a bit shameful to see how much time we waste away, so people are taking action against it."}
{"input": "Describe something that you brought home from a tourist attraction.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about my most recent trip in which I purchased a special souvenir. Well, a few months ago I went to Switzerland on holiday and brought home a painting from a local shop in Zurich. It was a bit of a hassle (annoying) to bring home because of the high taxes in the airport. However, it was such a nice piece of painting that it was worth it. It was a large oil painting that depicts (describe) a beautiful natural scenery common in Switzerland and not quite common in my homeland. I have hung it in my bedroom and it is now one of the most beautiful and cherished (special) souvenirs for me. I went on this trip in early March with my 2 friends. The alpine scenery, picturesque (attractive& interesting) villages, glittering (bright and shining) blue lakes, beautiful lakeside and astounding (appalling) tranquility of the villages took our breath away. Since we are artsy people, we attended an art festival in the mountains where I found this painting. As I don’t like keychains or T-shirts as much, I decided to bring this home as my only souvenir. Now, every time I look at this painting, it reminds me the exciting and memorable days I had spent on our holiday in Switzerland. Apart from that, the painting is a bit different than the other paintings I have in our house, so it really stands out (noticeable; different). This picture takes me back (to remind someone of something in the past) in time."}
{"input": "What kinds of souvenirs do people usually buy from tourist attractions?", "target": "Well it depends on the person, but I would say the most common souvenirs are keychains, mugs, magnets, shot glasses, art items, T-shirts, etc. I would say that people who have some sort of vice such as drinking or smoking usually go for a souvenir that suits this, such as a local liquor or a cigar from the specific place. However, children tend to buy some sort of toy or T-shirt related to the place. On the other hand, women tend to buy a clothing item or perhaps an accessory such as earrings, a necklace, or a scarf, where men tend to buy some sports memorabilia or the like."}
{"input": "Is it good that the locals sell things to tourists?", "target": "Yes! For many places, tourism is one of the only industries, so they have to take advantage of this. For example, a local can really benefit from selling their homemade crafts to a tourist. Of course the local benefits financially, but they could also get their name out there (become well-known/famous), while leaving the tourist with a one of a kind gift. On the other hand, the locals shouldn't be too aggressive or rip off (cheat financially) the tourists because it could turn the tourists off to the place. It's all a balance!"}
{"input": "Do you prefer to buy souvenirs or useful things? Why?", "target": "As I’m more of a practical person, I prefer to buy useful things or more experiences in the particular place that I visit. For example, I would much rather spend those $10 on a special meal or put it towards a tour rather than buying a T-shirt that I may never wear again. Furthermore, I’m really into photography, so a memorable moment captured in time is much more valuable than a magnet, mug, or shot glass could ever be to me. To celebrate my travels, I showcase my photography on social media and frame the pictures to hang on my walls."}
{"input": "What is your opinion about the asking price for souvenirs?", "target": "It depends! For example, I would never let myself be gouged (charged an unreasonably high price) buying a last-minute souvenir at an airport. Along with just the airports, many places elevate the prices in touristy areas. I think it's a bit unfair, but it's just kind of how it is. Of course I wouldn't want to be ripped off, but I can also understand that this is a good opportunity for especially impoverished countries to make money from wealthier tourists. In my opinion, the best souvenirs to buy are handicrafts from humble, local people on the streets or in a small shop."}
{"input": "Describe a time you looked for information from the internet.", "target": "I’m going to talk about this time when I needed a foreign book for my studies. I was in my senior year in university and we had this assignment that required us to find the latest medical breakthroughs (new information) on cancer, some of which are very hard to come by. So, I knew I needed to find this book ASAP. Apparently in order to get access to new data you must know the right source and pay some fees. I found out that the breakthroughs that I needed were published in a book, which was not yet for sale in my country. Moreover, even if I’d had it delivered, it would be too late by the time it arrived at my doorstep. I felt really uptight about it, but suddenly I thought of a solution. So, I decided to contact my former host family in the US to ask them to buy a hard copy then have the specific information scanned and emailed to me. It took some time but eventually I got the data in time. It was a bit of a hassle (something time-consuming) for my host family, so I decided to buy him a small gift in return."}
{"input": "What influence does the internet have on people (individually), and the society?", "target": "Well, for one, before the internet people interacted much more when meeting up and going out together, now you see people glued to (always looking at) their phone screens. Their focus is on their social media apps looking at what their friends and family are doing through photos and status updates, rather than actually talking to them. Communication is mostly through social media, with instant chat, cutting the need for face to face meetings. On the other hand, the internet has had a positive impact on society because now we can accomplish much more in a shorter time frame. Moreover, people can access information much quicker through google for example, so it creates a generation of well-informed people. Because of this, I believe that our future is very bright."}
{"input": "Do you think libraries will disappear one day?", "target": "I think this could be a possibility, as people are beginning to think that libraries are redundant (unnecessary), as the information is also available online. With devices such as E-books, Kindles, Amazon, etc., it’s normal to question how much longer libraries will last. For example, I never use the library because I see it as a hassle to have to check out the book and return it when I could just buy a used copy for next to nothing online from Amazon or borrow it from a friend. However, I still believe that a lot of people like to utilize libraries for the tangible value of holding a book in your hand and having a quiet, serene place to study; libraries have always been a staple to our academic world. So, with all of this said, I think libraries will stay around for at least the next 20 years."}
{"input": "What do people use the internet for?", "target": "Pretty much everything! Nowadays, there are countless apps at our fingertips to accomplish all of our tasks. For example, we use the internet to do research, pay our bills, find a dating match, go shopping, make phone calls, find jobs, chat with friends, find work out videos, etc. The better question would be what we don’t use the internet for nowadays. To be honest, I can’t think of any area of life where we don’t use the internet."}
{"input": "Would you say many people waste time \"surfing the internet\"?", "target": "For sure! Nowadays, the average person spends hours surfing the internet each day. Take me for example. My phone has recorded that I spend an average of 2 - 3 hours a day surfing the web on my phone, not to mention the 6 hours I’m constantly connected to it to carry out my work tasks. In some respects, it’s very useful to google things that you may be curious about throughout the day, but many people spend time surfing instagram or facebook watching lives of people they don’t even know, which is a 100% waste of time in my opinion."}
{"input": "How do you think people will be using the internet in 10 years (time)?", "target": "That’s a great question! It’s difficult to imagine this, but I would imagine we will continue to use it in all the respects that we do nowadays, but even at a more elevated level. For example, I’ve often speculated that we will have hologram images instead of video chats. On the other hand, I have a feeling that the online classroom will soon replace the traditional classroom. When it comes to the work world, I imagine that even more jobs will become remote. All in all, the world will continue to advance technologically."}
{"input": "Describe a city you went to with your family.", "target": "My family and I always had a dream vacation of going to New York city, better known as the Big Apple. The concrete jungle (a nickname for New York) where dreams come true. I would have to say that those were some of the best days of my life. It was around Christmas time, so we really wanted to see the decked out (decorated) New York that we had always seen on TV. Let me tell you how it came about So, by the end of 2018 we caught a flight from Portland to New York. I have to say that New Yorkers truly have the Christmas spirit. All of the city looked fairytale from Disney movies. While we were wandering around (walking around) the city, we saw a huge Christmas Three full of beautiful lights and sparkling star on top. It really took us back to the Home Alone movies! Seeing all of the Christmas decorations was the most outstanding part of the trip. Actually, it made me feel emotional to be standing there experiencing this with my family. It touched all of our hearts a lot. In conclusion, this trip took my breath away."}
{"input": "Do you think cities worth visiting is also suitable to live in?", "target": "Yes, I do. They are worth visiting for a reason. Whether they have iconic (famous) locations or fantastic restaurants, I would say that a city is not only worth visiting, but is also worth living. I’m a fan of (I like) the countryside too, but I always like to check out the capital city of a country too."}
{"input": "Do people in your country like to travel?", "target": "People in my country do love to travel a lot, mainly to Europe because you can breathe culture (take in) and history in every single country you visit, and countries are so small over there, that you can go through one of them in just 4 hours of driving, that’s fantastic!"}
{"input": "How has travelling changed, compared to several decades ago?", "target": "Well, several decades ago, travelling was more of a luxury option for people with a lot of money. Nowadays, it has changed and become more accessible to the middle class. You can easily get a roundtrip tickets to Paris for less than 200 dollars, before, that was bananas (crazy)!"}
{"input": "When do people travel (as tourists), who do they usually go with?", "target": "When people travel, they usually go with friends or family. Those ways are the most common, but for me the best way to travel is by yourself. It’s becoming more common for people to travel alone, but for me especially because I love the feeling of being able to do whatever I please at any given moment."}
{"input": "Do you think the internet has had an effect on people’s traveling behavior today?", "target": "It has deeply affected the way people travel, particularly in the way people buy plane tickets and layout their days at destination. Thanks to the internet, now you can buy plane tickets immediately, all you need to have is a credit or debit card. People also pick up their destination and determine what to do each day, based on the information they find online."}
{"input": "If you were going on a trip, what essential modern technology would you take with you, and why?", "target": "One of the essentials on my trips is my phone. I can’t survive without it, it brings me so much information about destination, like how to get there and what to see. To be honest, I’d be completely lost without google maps! I need all of that information right in the palm of my hand (accessible) to be able to proceed with my trip."}
{"input": "Describe a journey that you went on by car", "target": "It was the day before the long weekend of Labor Day and I had nothing to do, no plans, nothing at all. So, I decided to give my friends a shout (call my friends). Luckily, they were also free so we decided to spend this holiday together to celebrate all the hard work we do. This is how we started the road trip and I didn’t know it was going to be an outstanding experience. Let me tell you about it! We decided to go to the Grand Canyon, a place with beautiful landscapes and stunning hikes during the sunset. As soon as we arrived, the first task we completed was to set up the tents and a small fire near us because it was a pitch-black (very dark) night. We were lucky enough to see a shooting star going above our heads. The next morning, we woke up really early to start one of the most famous hikes of the area. I would have to say that it was worth every second of it. As we packed everything back to the cars to go back to the city, we saw a giant raven (large bird), trying to eat some leftovers from other camping grounds. That was just the perfect way to end the trip— in primitive (old) nature, yet having fun at the same time. That weekend was something else (something really special). I felt it was a bonding experience to get to know my friends more, as well as a nice time to unwind (relax) from our hectic (busy) lives in the city. In conclusion, it was one heck of a weekend (an awesome weekend)!"}
{"input": "Describe a journey that you went on by car", "target": "It was the day before the long weekend of Labor Day and I had nothing to do, no plans, nothing at all. So, I decided to give my friends a shout (call my friends). Luckily, they were also free so we decided to spend this holiday together to celebrate all the hard work we do."}
{"input": "Is driving skill important?", "target": "Indeed, it is not just important, it’s a necessity here in the US. Unlike Europe, cities were built for cars, not people, here."}
{"input": "Describe a time you spent a lot of money on something.", "target": "Well, let me tell you about a time I spent a lot of money. It was Christmas time, but also it was time to get a gift for myself. After a long year of hard work, not to mention a grueling (very difficult) one, it was time to spoil myself a little bit. I knew exactly what I wanted, which was the latest iPhone. I had had mine for about 3 years and I knew it was time for an upgrade. So, I carefully saved up money throughout the year so make sure I could provide this for myself at the end of the year. The day before Christmas I went into the C Train that takes to downtown and from the train station, I walked to about 15 minutes and I arrived at the Apple Store. I knew it was going to be a lot of money but I was aware that those products last for a very long time, that’s why I decided to get it. After leaving the cashier counter and leaving most of my money, I rapidly (quickly) went back to the train station with my bag on my hands and headed home. When I arrived there, I was so excited to open it as test the new phone. In conclusion, it was worth it!"}
{"input": "Why do young people tend to waste money?", "target": "People tend to waste more money because they like to flex (try to look cool) or pretend in front of their friends. They want to show that they can afford things that maybe the other can’t like the latest iPhone or expensive vacations. So, it’s all something superficial for young kids."}
{"input": "Why is it important for people to save some of their money?", "target": "Saving money is important because you don’t know how the future is going to be, maybe you will go through rough times where you wish you’ve saved all the money you spent on mundane objects. Still, I think it’s all about balance. Don’t fret (worry) over money too much, but also don’t spend it like a drunken sailor (like a crazy person)."}
{"input": "Should children be taught how to manage money?", "target": "Children should be taught how to manage their money, it is very important that from the very beginning we all know how to make the best use of our money- it could be saving or investing. Instead of learning so many mathematical skills that we may never use in the school system, I think they should have more classes like this."}
{"input": "Who is better at saving more money, men or women?", "target": "I would say that it does not depend on the gender, it depends fully in the kind of education we received as kids and also in schools. They say that men can be impulsive, but I know a fair share of women who are the same. On the other hand, perhaps women spend more on physical maintenance, but by the same token (in the same way), there are also many men who do so."}
{"input": "Describe a teenager you know", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a family friend of ours named Edward. He is 16 years old and bright (clever; intelligent) as can be. We have known him ever since he was 6 years old, and I’ve enjoyed watching him transform into the young man he is today. Nowadays, he’s even taller than me! I would say he’s almost 6 feet tall. He has a dark complexion and nearly black hair, now cut into one of the trendy styles with one side of it shaved. He’s blossoming into (changing into; like a flower) a handsome fellow (another word for boy or man)."}
{"input": "Why do you like him/her", "target": "I really care for Edward because he has always been an honest, polite kid and a joy to be around. He isn’t like the typical rebellious teenager who feels they are too cool for everything and everyone around them. He always greets me with a hug and shows me a lot of respect. For this reason, I have really taken a liking to him. On another note, he is extremely hard-working and intelligent."}
{"input": "\"Describe a time the vehicle you were travelling in broke down.\"", "target": "\"Well, there is no doubt that the invention of vehicles made our lives more convenient and comfortable. Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, distances are made much shorter since there are various modes of transportation available such as buses, trains, bikes, and cars. Most of the time, I prefer to use my own car for traveling. Luckily, I had not faced many problems with my car. However, I would like to share an incident when my car was broken down on the side of the road while traveling. A couple of months before, I traveled to Leeds with my husband. We started our journey full of excitement but unfortunately, when we reached the 100k mark, suddenly our car started making a strange noise. We stopped the car on the left side of the road and tried to check out the issue. Although we didn't find any problem, the sound of the engine was becoming louder and louder. After a few minutes, the whole situation became worse, and we even saw smoke coming out of the engine! This was the first time our car gave us such trouble. Luckily, my husband had a service center number in his pocket. So we called a mechanic for car repair. By the grace of God, the service center was near us, so a mechanic arrived in five minutes. He checked the car's engine properly and replaced a belt as well as the coolant. All in all, it took an hour to repair. Finally, our car's engine started again and we felt extremely relieved to see it work properly. My feelings of frustration instantly went away. All in all, it was a smooth fix.\""}
{"input": "Describe a time you gave advice to others.", "target": "I tend to have close relationships with my friends, and am always eager (ready) to help them out. I have this friend in particular who I’ve grown up with (known since children); we’re pretty close. I will tell you about some serious career advice I gave him recently. Well, here’s some background: Last year he was working at an international company and doing quite well, so he was offered a big promotion to become a manager. However, he had also been looking for opportunities to study abroad, and had recently received an offer from a prestigious university around the same time he got the job offer. It was a scholarship that would cover all expenses, including tuition and accommodation, an enviable package. So, he was really in a pickle (in a difficult situation) over what to do. It was tough for him to decide whether to pursue his career or his education. So, we met up to discuss this. When he asked for my advice, I told him that if he wanted to be successful in his field, he needed to possess excellent qualifications. If he didn’t, there would be a limit to how far he could reach. Although this promotion may look good now, there may be a small window (limits) for growth. After this advice, he decided to take my advice and is now studying at Yale. All in all, he saw that pursuing his education would pay off (benefit) more in the future."}
{"input": "Describe a period of time in the history of your country that you want to know more about.", "target": "Well, my country has been through several historical events under various rulers and governments. This has led to the long and highly fascinating (interesting) history of my country to be written for everyone to know and benefit from. I am fond of (like) reading history in general, however, the most fascinating period to me is from the year 1940 to 1947. It was the last phase of the Indian independence movement while still under British rule. With this said, the British rule in India lasted for nearly two hundred years. It was in 1947 on the fifteenth of August that India had finally gained its freedom from the oppressive and tyrannical British rule."}
{"input": "What happened during that period of time", "target": "I am fascinated in gaining knowledge about all the proceedings that took place in this period, as it’s something I am most curious about. I first came across (found) information about this era in my eighth-grade history book. Since then, I have spoken to my grandparents at length (a long time) on this topic. They have shared stories of freedom fighters standing up against the British army for their rights, apart from many of their own personal accounts (experiences) during that time. Furthermore, I have also read many books and watched various movies and documentaries on this subject to expand my knowledge even more."}
{"input": "Who played an important role in this period of time", "target": "All in all, this era is full of various occurrences on a mass scale and involves sacrifices of innumerable (countless) freedom fighters who gave away everything they had in order to fight the British rule."}
{"input": "And explain why you want to know more about the time period", "target": "In conclusion, it is indeed one of the most essential (important) periods in shaping my country’s history."}
{"input": "Describe a piece of advice you received on your subjects or work", "target": "Well, getting feedback about our performance is simply part of life, whether it be positive or negative. I always thought I was doing all the right things at my job, but the assessment day came and turned out (result) that I wasn’t performing up to par (up to standards). I noticed that since my manager called me to his office and told me to close the door. “I hope this is not that serious” I said, and then he responded “we need to talk”. At that very moment I realized I was doing something wrong at work. My manager started to talk to me about my performance and it was all good but the delivery time of the financial charts were not ideal. He gave me a great advice on how I should manage all the workload I had in order to be able to deliver the financial reports on time."}
{"input": "Describe a situation when you didn't have enough time. You should say: - when it was - where you were - what you tried to do or finish - and explain why you didn't have enough time for it.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a time I was overwhelmed. I was doing extra hours at work for a co-worker who was ill, so I already had plenty on my plate (to have a lot to do). To add to this, my friend asked me to help her out with an online project of hers, which required a lot of time, energy, and research. Let me give you more details. Well, this was just the other week actually in my hometown. She’s been a long-time friend of mine, so I really wanted to give her a hand, but I simply couldn't manage it. It was a very time-sensitive project, so I didn't want to accept it then later give up. However, she pushed me into it so I ended up doing what I could of it. The thing that really bugged me was that she made it seem like it would be a simple activity, but it required me to research online for several hours, not to mention then writing out documents for about 6 hours each; there were 4 separate assignments. So, in the end, I did one assignment part of it then sent it back to her and told her she would have to make other arrangements. I usually work about 40 hours a week, however, it was over 50 with my extra hours that week, so I simply didn't have much time to spare (extra). Actually, I don't think it would have been possible to add another 24 hours of work onto that week. Furthermore, I have to be energetic at my job to be able to effectively sell new products, so I definitely cannot neglect my sleep schedule. All in all, it was just an inconvenient time!"}
{"input": "Describe a time that you visited a friend", "target": "I’m going to tell you about a special trip I embarked (went) on to see a friend of mine. In October of last year, I went to visit my best friend Michael, who moved to Colorado Springs just a few months before I visited. Visiting Michael was the best excuse to visit a city I always wanted to visit but also to see a dear friend. Let me tell you about this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Colorado Springs is a well-known city for its hot springs, which are wonderful natural hot water springs, ideal for a relaxing afternoon. Besides these, there are snow-capped mountains lining the skyline and endless forests to discover. We spent the weekend snow-shoeing (hiking with special snow shoes) and relaxing at night with a nice hot spring bath. This entire adventure started as soon as I set foot out of the airport there!"}
{"input": "Do you think that it is becoming more difficult to make friends?", "target": "Lately, it is becoming more difficult to make friends and this is caused by social media, even though technology is supposed to connect us in an easier way, it makes it harder to connect face to face. With this said, I feel we are becoming less social, so it’s more challenging to strike up (start) a conversation with a stranger. Although we can stay in better touch with our old friends due to social media, all in all, it has made making lasting friendships harder."}
{"input": "What do you think of making friends on the internet?", "target": "Making friends online could be both good and bad. It all depends on the luck you have and what web pages or apps you use to make friends. For example, when I moved to a new city, I used MeetUp, which led me to find free yoga classes with some of the best people I could ever dream of. So, it can be a hit or miss (a success or a failure)."}
{"input": "\"Describe a historical period you are interested in.\"", "target": "\"I’m going to tell you about the Spanish conquest of the Incas, as I studied Latin American History at University. Simply put, The Incas always left me in awe (amazed). Furthermore, this has always been an important subject to me, because the Incas made groundbreaking (amazing, new) achievements in mathematics, architecture, astronomy, and art. When I analyze (deeply study) the Spanish conquest, I reflect on the Inca’s historical significance, which has persevered despite the loss of the civilization. This has really moved (had an emotional effect) me. Now that you now why I’m fond of (like) this, let me give you a summary of the ins and outs (details) of their story.\""}
{"input": "\"What happened during that period?\"", "target": "\"During this period, between 1532 and 1574, Spanish and Inca nobles brutally (bloody, cruel) fought for dominance in the region. The Spaniards believed that they should rule, and that their moral beliefs were superior to the Incas. The Incas fought to protect their home territory. However, this is a complicated period in history, because many indigenous subjects joined the Spaniards in these battles. They saw red (to be angry) when it came to the the Inca rule. The extra help ultimately led the Spanish to victory.\""}
{"input": "\"Why do you find it interesting?\"", "target": "\"I find this period fascinating because we can learn a lot from it in the present; you can clearly see the correlation (relationship). Many scholars would like to know more about the Inca past, but learn very little because colonial Spanish writings are often dismissive (don’t accept) of Inca technology, and we don’t have Inca writings to help us understand them better. All in all, we learn that there are tragic historical consequences of colonial conquests, and we hope to learn from them in the present.\""}
{"input": "Describe someone you would like to study or work with. You should say: who this person is, how long you have known this person, what you have done together, and why you would like to study or work with this person.", "target": "I’m going to tell you about my friend Veronica. She is the type of friend that you know always has good intentions (kind, means well) and would never do anything to hurt you. Furthermore, she is extremely loyal, understanding, and down to earth (not thinking she is better than others). Even though she is a highly educated and intelligent person, she would never use these qualities to be condescending to another person. We first met back in 2016 in a month-long, intensive Spanish class in Cusco, Peru. The nature of our class there was very open, causing us to share private details about our lives and even embarrassing stories, so this made it easier to get closer as a class. We spent 7 hours a day together in that class, along with about 10 others, so I would say we got to know each other very well. When we broke into (divided) groups, we would often work together which always went well. I felt that she was always a helpful classmate, never one to make you feel dumb for not knowing an answer. After the class, we remained close friends throughout our entire year in Cusco. During that entire time, she never did anything that rubbed me the wrong way (to make angry). With all this said, this is why I would enjoy studying or working with Veronica. I feel that she would always remain sincere, regardless of any cutthroat (bad intentions) workplace environment or competitive or prestigious (of high class) academia. Furthermore, I feel that she would always be there to help me out, and I would never worry that she would be conniving. Lastly, I see that she is a hard-working, dedicated person, so that would make her an even better candidate. Since we already have some experience as classmates and even more as friends, this is why I chose to talk about her."}
{"input": "Describe a place where you read and write (not your home).;", "target": "Well, there is a cabin I like to go every time I feel like writing or reading. It is located up in the North side of West Vancouver. Wonderful place, usually covered by snow throughout the whole year. That sensation of escape and freedom that this cabin gives me, makes me want to write and read. Just being there sitting by the chimney with a cup of chocolate, is one of the most relaxing sensations you ever imagine. I even like to draw a hot bubble bath and read in the tub there, which is truly sublime (unworldly).;"}
{"input": "Is there a completely quiet place?;", "target": "Yes, there are a lot of quiet places, like lakes or mountains, where you can and feel like you are all alone and in the middle of nowhere. Most of these places are located far into remote forests or in the middle of deserts. Actually, I don’t often visit places like this, but I’ve always seen them in films.;"}
