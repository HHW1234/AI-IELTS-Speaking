###1. Islands

1 .1. Have you ever been to any island?
Yes, I have! Actually, I lived on an island for 3 months back in 2016. My mother
was offered to work at a resort for 2 years, so I joined them there for 3 months.
Island life was quite an interesting experience!
1 .2. Are there any islands in your country?
Yes, there are. There is one famous island called X, famed for its crystal clear
water and white sands. I’ve heard the pagodas are very interesting to visit there,
as well. I haven’t been yet, but I dream of going there for a girls getaway (when
women go on a trip together) sometime in the future.
1.3. Do you want to live on an island if you have a chance?
Not really. Islands are beautiful, but I felt really isolated (separated from
others) when I lived on one before. As I’m an active person, I felt there wasn’t
much to do. Sure, the beach is great, but it gets boring day after day.
1 .4. What do you like to do when you are on an island?
Beach of course! Behind that, I like getting to know the local culture and food. I
especially enjoy drinking coconut water fresh off the palm trees and trying local
fish recipes. Moreover, I enjoy getting hair braided (hairstyle) by local people.

### 2. Makeup

2 .1. Do you often wear makeup?
Yes, almost everyday. If I’m just bumming (relaxing) around the house, I don’t
bother putting make-up on. However, I have a very professional job, so I always
put on my best attire (clothes) and make-up when I go to work. If I go without

make-up, I feel sloppy (messy) and unprofessional. I also like to wear make
up when I go out, just so I feel more confident with my appearance.
2 .2. What does wearing makeup mean to you?
To me, it’s a way of taking pride in (be proud of) my appearance. It makes
me feel like the best version of myself. Furthermore, I’m artistic, so I see my
face like a canvas (a picture painted with oil paints on canvas or
other cloth)
2 .3. Do you give makeup as a gift?
Sometimes, but I’m always hesitant, as I don’t always know the right shade of
make-up to buy for another person. If someone requests make-up, I would
certainly buy it for them. However, I would feel too nervous to pick it out myself,
so I would opt for buying a gift card instead.
2 .4. What do you think when you see a man wearing makeup?
Nothing in particular. Everyone has the right to express themselves, so who
am I to judge? I wouldn’t even blink an eye if a guy walked by me wearing
make-up. Actually, I often see it in my city, so I’m quite used to it.

### 3. Perfume

3.1. Do you like perfume?
Yes, I do! As I'm an athlete who sweats a lot, I t end to (usually) have a strong
odor. Because of this. I buy perfume incase I don't have time to take a shower
before I go out.
3.2. Do you use perfume?
Everyday! I always use it after my soccer practice as well as before dates with
my boyfriend. It makes me feel a lot more feminine and confident.
3.3. How much money do you spend on perfume?
Although I don't earn a great salary, I budget (plan an amount of money to
be spent) to be able to buy a new bottle of Chanel perfume every few months.

It costs around \$80 a bottle. Sometimes when I run out (to finish) of perfume,
I temporarily use a body spray which is around $15 a bottle.
3.4. Have you ever given perfume as a gift?
Hmm let me think. Actually, I haven't. I feel nervous to choose a scent for
someone in case they don't like it, so I would rather (give them a gift card to a
department store so they can choose their own.
3.5. Would you ever give perfume as a gift?
Although I don't prefer it, I would definitely give it as a gift. However, I would
make sure that I knew the brand or scent that they like before I buy it. I know
that perfume is a sensitive gift to give someone!

### 4. Transportation

4.1. What’s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
Without any doubt I would say motorbikes. Almost everyone travels by
motorbike. The reason why motorbike is so popular I think is due to their
reasonable price and convenience. They also extremely varied in terms of size,
color and quality, thus a wide variety of choices is available for everyone.

4.2. How often do you take buses?
Almost every day. Since my house is so far away from my university, it’s
impossible for me to travel by motorbike. In addition, the air is heavily polluted
by exhaust fumes and traffic jams always take place, especially during peak
hours. Thus, I’d prefer to take the bus, to save time, save gasoline and causing
less pollution.

4.3. Can you compare the advantages of planes and trains?
Planes and trains regularly depart and arrive on time. Plus, there are many
convenient facilities catering particularly to certain groups of passengers.
However, traveling by plane is clearly time-saving and enjoyable in terms of on-
board services like meals or comfortable seats, while traveling by train offers
you a chance to see the world outside, admire the views from their seats.
It’s totally a great experience for most train-travelers.

4.4. Is driving to work popular in your country?
Although cars themselves and gasoline are expensive, a lot of people prefer
driving, possibly because driving is more comfortable in such weather, with such
polluted and noisy surroundings.
4.5. Do you think people will drive more in the future?
If you’re talking about India, no, I don’t think it’s possible, even in the future.
Cars and gasoline are becoming unaffordable for many people these days.
Plus, the transport infrastructure in various regions in India is not appropriate
for cars.

4.6. Would you ride bikes to work in the future?
Definitely not. Riding a bike means you’re exposing yourself to the
unpredictable weather and to air pollution. What is worse, I’m afraid the main
streets or the highway are too dangerous for cyclists, as cars, motorbikes and

buses will travel at a very high speed. Thus I’d rather ride a motorbike or take
the bus instead.

4.7. What will become the most popular means of transport in your
country?
I think buses will take the lead. You can travel the distance without much
worries about ticket price or rainy weather outside. Also new buses now offer
better services like comfortable seats for the elderly or good air conditioning
systems.

4.8. Do you prefer public transport or private transport?
I think I’d prefer public transport. It’s much more inexpensive and because it can
contain a large number of people, it helps ease the intensity of traffic jams
during peak hours and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions caused by
vehicles. Private transportation is more costly in terms of fees, taxes and
gasoline.

### 5. Trust

5.1. Who do you trust most?
I would have to say my father. Although we have our differences, I know he is
100% someone I can count on (depend on). I feel that I could tell him any secret, and I know that he would never spill the beans (tell a secret) to anyone.
He is a very trustworthy and sincere person.
5.2. What kind of people do you trust?
I trust people who are transparent, those who are open with their emotions.
When I feel someone keeps everything inside, I wonder what it is that they have
to hide, so naturally my trust lessens. Furthermore, I trust people who aren’t
always just looking out to gain something for themselves, and someone who
doesn’t have a criminal background, especially involving theft.
5.3. Have you ever lost trust in somebody?
Of course! In high school, my best friend and I were attached at the hip (very
close). We used to have sleepovers (when kids sleep at each other’s
houses) almost every weekend, until one day my mother discovered that my
friend was stealing money from her savings jar. Since that day, I felt that I
couldn’t trust someone who would take advantage of my mother who always
opened her home to my friend.
5.4. Do you trust artificial intelligence?
That’s an interesting question. Well, I believe that technology nowadays is
advanced enough to create intelligence, but I wouldn’t say that it’s equal to
human intelligence. While a robot may be better on paper (objectively more
intelligent), they lack feelings, which leads me to believe that they aren’t
emotionally and/or socially intelligent, which ties everything together. So, all in
all, I’m not overly trusting of artificial intelligence.

### 6. Borrowing & Lending

6.1. Have you ever borrowed books from others?
Yes, I have! Actually, my friends and I often have a book exchange. I see it as
a waste of money to buy every book you want to read, so it’s very effective to
do this! I always look forward to (excited for) the books I’ll get from them.
6.2. Have you ever borrowed money from others?

Who hasn’t? It isn’t something I enjoy doing, but something that has been
necessary at certain points. For example, one time my washing machine and
oven broke simultaneously (at the same time) , so I asked my father if he
could lend me some money to get a new one. I, of course, paid him back as
soon as I could.
6.3. Do you like to lend things to others?
I would say so. To be honest, I’m always skeptical (suspicious) when I lend
money to people because I’m afraid they won’t pay me back, but I do it for family
members and friends when they need it anyway. Fortunately, I have friends and
family that will willingly do the same for me.
6.4. How do you feel when people don’t return things they borrowed from
you?
Upset, of course. I am a person of my word (does what I say) , so I feel upset
when others aren’t. I have been very irritated several times when people,
especially my little sister, has borrowed something from me and lost or
damaged it. However, if it wasn’t something very valuable, I try to remember
that it isn’t the end of the world (something big or important).
6.5 Do people feel embarrassed when they request the things back from
friends?
My ears often turn red out of embarrassment when I ask things back from my
friends. It's natural because I don’t want to undermine the relationship we are
having and requesting stuff back can hurt others’ pride and self-respect.

### 7. Mathematics

7.1. Do you like math?
  Not at all! Maths has always been my worst subject. While I can write an
  amazing essay or learn foreign languages easily, I can't seem to understand
  numbers very well. I always feel stressed and frustrated with myself in Maths
  class for not being able to think logically.

7.2. Do you think females are good at maths?
  Hmm, I can't say. I haven't noticed whether one gender is better than the other
  at Maths. However, I've heard the stereotype that women don't tend to think as
  logically as men, so maybe this affects their mathematical abilities.
7.3. When did you start learning Math?
  Since I was 6 years old, maybe even 5. I remember doing some basic addition
  activities, such as counting chickens on the board. After that, we progressed
  onto subtraction, and then even multiplication tables and division!
7.4. Do you think maths is important?
  Yes, I do. However, I don't think that advanced math subjects, such as Calculus,
  Trigonometry, Geometry, etc. are very applicable in day-to-day life. On the other
  hand, basic math such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are
  something that we use everyday, such as at the grocery store or work.
7.5. Who taught you maths?
  My teachers, with my parents’ help at home. It all started with very basic
  equations like “If I take away one of these jelly beans, how many are there?”,
  which my parents practiced with me at home, also. But, first and foremost, it
  started at school.
7.6. Is maths difficult for you to learn?
  Totally! I tend to have a more abstract (illogical) brain, so I am more apt (able)
  to subjects like art, literature, or music. Math was always the class I would dread
  (not look forward to) all day. Actually, I even failed Geometry in high school.
  7.7.Do you like to use a calculator?
  Yes! Calculators have made life much more convenient. Thinking back, I can’t
  remember a time without them. I remember my high school algebra teacher
  didn’t believe in them, which made the class even more of a challenge.
  However, I agree with her to an extent because it strengthened my mental
  math (math in your head) skills!

### 8. Smiling

8.1. Do you like to smile?
I love it! I have traveled extensively and seen that some other cultures smile
more than others. When someone smiles, it brings me positive energy and
instantly improves my mood. With this said, I have taken it upon myself to smile
as much as possible to give others a warm feeling.
8.2. How often do you smile?
As much as possible! I've noticed that even when I'm having a bad day, a smile
or laugh always helps. So, I try to smile whenever I meet or pass someone, as
well as after a bad day.
8.3. Do you smile when you are having your picture taken?
Yes, I do! Although I prefer a more serious look for my selfies which shows off
my bone structure more, I always smile in a group photo. Actually, sometimes I
can't help but to smile because I am having such a good time!
8.4. When do people smile to others?
In many different cases, but I would say usually when they make eye contact
with someone or to people in their workplace. In my country, people usually
don't smile at everyone on the streets because that person may suspect us of
wanting something from them.
8.5. Can you sense (or feel, or tell) if someone's smile is fake?
Yes, I can! I can sense a fake smile but how much it looks forced. When
someone's smile is fake, they smile with just their mouth instead of their eyes.
With this said, you can always tell a genuine smile by the eyes.

### 9. Time management

9 .1 How do you organize your time?
Hmm, well I'm not always the most organized person, but the good thing is that
I'm not a procrastinator (someone who waits until the last minute). I always

do what needs to be done first, such as my errands or work tasks. After I do
what I need to do, I will then allow myself to relax.
9 .2. Do you make plans every day?
No, I don't. I'm more of a spontaneous (unplanned) person. I don't like to plan
every second of every day, as plans can quickly change. I only plan out what I
need to do and how to get it done, but I let my social interactions come up
(arise) unplanned.
9 .3. Would you say you manage your time well?
More or less. I'm not the most organized nor disorganized person on the planet.
However, I can say with certainty that I always complete what is asked of me.
On the other hand, I sometimes can't do things like plan vacations very well.
9 .4. Are you ever late for anything?
Once in a blue moon (very rarely)! I am a stickler (serious) about time, so I
am almost never late. When I think about it, the only times I've been late for
work were because of a traffic jam or an accident.
9 .5. Do you think young people organize their time in the same way?
No, I don't. I think that's too general of a question. I believe everyone organizes
their time in different ways. However, young people tend to have heavy work
and study schedules, so they may not be able to manage their time and tasks
as well as someone who doesn't. So, in this case, young people have to
prioritize(decide what is most important) more.
9 .6. What's the biggest difficulty you have when managing time?
I would have to say my social life. As I have a demanding work schedule, I tend
to lose track of time and forget to add in time to spend with my friends and
family. I am looking for a way to manage this better.

### 10. Flats/Houses/Accommodation

10.1. Do you like a house or a flat/ an apartment?

I believe most people would prefer to have their own house rather than to rent
a place and so do I. Hence, if I have my way , a house with a small garden
would be my choice since I don’t enjoy the constant disturbance from next-door
apartments and elevator rides everytime coming home.

10.2. What kind of housing/accommodation do you live in?
For the past 21 years I have lived in a house with my family. And I think if I can
move out and start making a living on my own, I would try my best to have an
independent place where I can plan and design a house layout to suit myself
since sharing a room or a flat with strangers sounds so troublesome to me.

10.3. What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?
Well definitely I’ll spend some me-time there. I study, I chill out by
reading, drawing and dancing all by myself. Sometimes I also invite one or two
friends to spend time with. We’ll watch some movies together and tell each
other endless stories.

10.4. Who do you live with?
I live with my family. There are 5 of us and we all have our own room, which is
way more comfortable as the older we grow, the more privacy we need for
ourselves. I think our house is big enough for us yet still a warm and cozy place
that I call home.

10.5. How long have you lived there?
Although during my childhood my family had to move a lot, I’ve lived in the most
recent house for almost ten years. Comparing to the old houses, I think this
house has been the best so far.
10.6. Do you plan to live there for a long time?
The answer would be yes if the respondent is my parents, since moving in and
out is too time-consuming and exhausting. Cleaning and arranging everything
all over again would be like torture to them. For me, on the other hand, as I’m
thinking of moving out to start my adult life, hopefully soon I’ll be able to afford
to live in a flat or an apartment.

10.7. What’s the difference between where you are living now and where
you have lived in the past?
As I’ve already mentioned my family moved several times when I was younger.
And the most current house where we’ve been living for about ten years is the
best house so far. All of us have separate rooms for our need of privacy yet a
big dining room where we can spend the whole evenings together watching TV
or having dinner.

10.8. Can you describe the place where you live?/ Please describe the
room you live in
Briefly, my humble house locates in a small and quite street, so coming home
to me is like all the craziness happened outside is left behind. Just beside my
house stands a big old tree. I have my own room with walls painted violet, which

is kinda a peaceful color. The air outside is fresh. I usually open the window to
enjoy the wind and sunshine, which will help cool down my room without an air
conditioner. Since I spend most of my time staying at home, my room means
the whole world to me. It’s like a friend who is always there to share ups and
downs with me. So yeah, I would always miss my house, my room whenever
I’m away.
10.9. Which part of your home do you like the most?
It’s the dining room where my family spends our time together. Not only lunch
or dinner but all our family reunions take place in the dining room where we
can enjoy a harmonious atmosphere. We always try to keep the family dinner
as something we cannot go a day without , since for us it’s the family bonding
that lies behind.
10.10. Why do you think some people invest a huge amount of money in
buying houses?
People certainly have different reasons to buy a property. I believe the most
important one is privacy. You will gain much more independence and freedom
to refurbish the place as you please since you are the owner. Besides, it would

create a pride of ownership. No matter how small or big your house is, it is
yours to renovate or brag about.
10.11. Should we live in a flat or a house?
It heavily depends on people’s preference and affordability since each type of
property has its own perks. If one enjoys the modern amenities that an
apartment complex can provide such as gyms, swimming pools and
convenience stores and, of course, he has money, an apartment would be a
great choice. In contrast, houses are usually suitable those who prefer privacy
and a quiet lifestyle.

### 11. Reading

11.1. Do you like reading?
Yes, I’m definitely a book worm (a person who loves to read)! I believe that
books are a way to not only escape, but also to gain more knowledge. By the

same token, people who read tend to have a richer vocabulary and a higher
level of general knowledge, so they tend to have more to converse about.
11.2. What books do you like to read?
I’m definitely a fan of fiction. I don’t know why, but I’ve always been more into
reading about real-life accounts, self-help books, or biographies rather than far-
fetched (unreal) fantasies or science fiction novels. I know it’s an unpopular
opinion, but I’ve never liked Harry Potter or Star Wars!
11.3. What book did you read recently?
I recently read a book by a Buddhist monk called “How to Love”. The book goes
over (reviews) the ways to love someone in a nourishing way, such as giving
them freedom and always searching for understanding rather than seeking
possession.
11.4. What did you learn from it?
I learned so much from this book! I learned about different meditation uniques
and some new ideas on how to define love. After reading this book, I felt in such
a deep zen (relaxed) state.
11.5. What was your favorite book as a child?
I remember being very fond of a book called “My Sister’s Keeper”. I recall that
it was the story of two sisters, one of which needed a kidney transplant.
Although the sister was initially apprehensive (scared; nervous) to do so, she
ended up donating a kidney to her sister and saving her.

### 12. Rubbish/ Garbage

12.1. Do you think it’s important to keep the city clean?
Very! Our future generation relies on what we do to take care of our planet in
the present. Furthermore, I believe we all have a social responsibility to do what
we can to keep it as clean as possible. It is negative to our health, as well as
how it looks aesthetically (appealing to beauty) to have a dirty city.

12.2. Do you recycle things like paper and plastic?
Always. First, I separate the garbage in my house into paper, plastic, glass, etc
then take it to the recycling bin which is available in my condominium complex.
Along with this, I reuse plastic as often as possible.
12.3. What do you do when you see rubbish on the street?
Pick it up. If I can find a garbage can or recycling bin, I’ll take it there. If I can’t,
I’ll carry it with me until I can dispose of it at my house. I know it’s yucky
(disgusting) to carry it around, but it’s worth it.
12.4. Can you suggest why some people throw their litter on the ground?
I think it could be because of lack of concern, ignorance, or perhaps lack of
education. I think this education all starts at home and school, so they just
simply may not know if they never learned. Furthermore, I think some people
simply don’t care because they don’t think their one small act with have a
negative effect on the planet.
12.5. Would you like to help other people to keep your town or city tidy?
Absolutely! I love to take part in city clean-up activities. It would be my dream
to start my own NGO, so I’m even thinking about creating one with an
environmental cause. Apart from this, I’m a teacher, so I always integrate
environmental topics into my classes.
12.6. Do you think plastic bags are a serious environmental problem?
Very! They aren’t the only subject to focus on, but there is concrete evidence of
the negative effects that plastic has on our entire planet and ecosystems, as it
cannot decompose. I feel very upset when I see videos of animals dying from
ingesting plastic, etc.
12.7. Do you think it's important to protect the environment?
Very! It isn’t something that only affects us, but also our future generations. If
we destroy the planet now, there won’t be a healthy one for our children,
grandchildren, and so on. Furthermore, along with humans, we also have to
think about the state of our ecosystems in order to create a sustainable future.

12.8. Do you think schools should educate children to protect the
environment?
Of course! Education is a very powerful tool to change the world. We have to
educate them on even the simple steps they can take to create a more
sustainable future, as well as let them know the risks we face. Moreover, we
have to show them the significance of it all.

### 13. Tea or coffee

13.1. What do you prefer, tea or coffee?
I’m definitely more of a tea person. However, I need a cup or two of coffee to
shift myself into gear (to get started) in the morning. After this, I always stick
with (choose) tea. Coffee tends to make me feel a bit anxious, whereas tea
gives me a natural, energized feeling. Moreover, tea has more health benefits
for me, especially since I’m prone to (easily get) colds and coughs.
13.2. What do you usually prepare for your guests, tea or coffee?
Definitely tea. As I don’t have a coffee-maker or French press , I wouldn't want
to serve instant coffee, so I always heat up water in my kettle and serve some
tea, either in bags or fresh. Since I have quite a collection of different teas, I feel
prouder to share this with my guests.
13.3. When was the last time you drank coffee or tea?
Just before this exam actually! I drank 2 cups of green tea this morning with my
breakfast. As I was a tad nervous, I decided not to drink coffee this morning, as
it sometimes causes me to feel jittery (nervous and shaking).

### 14. Forest

### 14.1.When was the last time you went to a forest?

Hmm, let me think, it’s been a while. Well, a couple years ago, my boyfriend
and I went on a hike through a forest on the border of Germany and Belgium. It
was really beautiful! The pine trees and thick greenery were really impressive.
14.2. Do you like to go to a forest if you are free?
I like it, but it wouldn’t be my first place. Instead of a forest, I would rather go to
the beach or the mountains. There’s something I find a little eerie (creepy)
about being in a forest. I always fear the critters (animals) , or even worse the
people who could be lurking around (hanging out) in the forest.

### 15. Social Network

15.1. Are you a social person?
Very much so! I feel that I thrive on (survive) social interactions. I like a small
amount of time to myself each day, but I feel most charged when I spend time
with others. I prefer to spend my free time with friends or family rather than
being in my room reading a book, for instance.
15.2. What kind of social networking websites do you like to use?
Just the usual ones, like Facebook and Instagram. I used to be into
(interested) posting positivity on Facebook, but now I prefer to post just
photography on Instagram instead. As I’m an avid (experienced) traveler, I like
to showcase my photography as a way to share my stories with others.
15.3. What kind of people do you like to be friends with on those websites?
All kinds! I am friends with a wide range of people from my school years, family
members, and friends I’ve recently met. Actually, I’m even friends with people
who I’ve never even met before.
15.4. Is it easy to find a real friend on a social networking website?
It depends. The thing is, I think people are superficial on social media sites, and
that some people lie about their identities. However, I think one can still meet a
genuine friend online, but they must practice more caution.
15.5. What kinds of chatting apps do people in your country like to use?

I would say the most common are Facebook messenger, Imessage, Instagram
Direct Message, and Whatsapp. Nowadays, as most people have Iphones, I
think Imessage is the most prominent, followed by Instagram.

### 16. Visiting Relatives

16.1. Do you often visit your relatives? (Why?)
Yes, I do! When I was younger, I used to find it boring, but now that I'm older, I
cherish (enjoy/value) the time I have with my relatives. I plan to see different
relatives every Sunday.
16.2. What do you do when you visit them?
We usually keep it pretty simple. We tend to have a meal at one of our houses
or just sit in the living room and talk. From time to time, we decide to go out to
eat or to do something else, like maybe the cinema or the park.
16.3. When was the last time you visited them? what did you do?
Just this morning actually! I went over to bring my grandparents lunch, since
they aren't very mobile anymore. We ate chicken salad then I helped them pay
their bills online and chatted.
16.4. Do you prefer visiting your relatives, or your friends?
I like both for different reasons. I would say I probably enjoy seeing my friends
more because it's a time to de-stress and have fun, whereas seeing family
involves more stress and judgment. However, I think family is more important.
16.5. Do you take anything when you visit your relatives?
Of course! I always try to bring some flowers or some sort of contribution to the
meal, as I'm not one who likes to show up empty-handed (with nothing). I
especially like to bring something to my relatives after a vacation, like a
souvenir- such a keychain, magnet, or T-shirt.

### 17. Amusement Park

17.1. Do you like amusement parks?
I love them! I think they are something that all ages can enjoy. I still feel just as
excited about them now as I did when I was a child. There’s nothing like the
feeling of your stomach dropping on a rollercoaster.
17.2. How often do you go to amusement parks?
Not very often anymore, maybe once every few years. However, in the past, we
used to go every year. Nowadays, we go every few years. We’re planning on
going to Six Flags this October for Halloween, actually. They always have a
special event there with haunted houses and costumes!
17.3. What do you usually do at amusement parks?
Rides, eat at concession stands, go swimming, and wait in line for a long time!
My favorite rides are roller coasters and water rides, especially on hot days. For
example, I love the log flume ride where you get a huge splash at the end.
Moreover, I love the wave pools (a pool with generated waves) and lazy
rivers (rivers where you relax and float).

### 18. Tiredness

18.1. What kinds of things make you tired?
I’m generally a lethargic (tired; low energy) person, so I tend to get tired
easily. I usually start to feel sleepy when I sit in a boring lecture and work in an
office. Moreover, I tend to feel tired when I eat too much or drink alcohol.
18.2. What do you do when you feel tired?
Sometimes I decide to fight it with a cup of coffee or another form of caffeine,
or I simply surrender (give up) and take a nap. However, when I take a nap, I
tend to sleep for too long and feel even more tired afterwards, so it’s better to
fight through my fatigue (tired).
18.3. Who do you usually talk to when you feel mentally tired?

Just my closest friends or family. When I feel that way, I don’t like to be in social
situations in which I have to meet new people because I feel that I can’t give my
best self to them. I would rather retire to my room to listen to some music and
fall asleep.
18.4. Do you like to talk to strangers when you feel mentally tired?
Not at all. I like to have full energy when I meet new people. When I meet new
people when I’m exhausted, I feel dull (boring) and unable to engage in
meaningful conversation.

### 19. Work/Study

19.1.What is your job?
I’m the founder and project manager for a volunteer organization called Corazon
de Apus. We find local children living in poverty or with difficult family situations
and bring them to a safe place after school where they can learn English with
the volunteers from Western countries, get homework help, and simply play and
escape their problems. We also pitch in (everyone gives some money) to
provide them with school supplies, dental care, and uniforms.
19.2.How long have you been doing your job?
This is my 4th year on the job. Actually, at university I studied Finance, but I
realized a 9- 5 isn’t for me. I knew I needed to do a job that helps those in need.
However, my finance skills do come in handy (are useful) in this job!
19.3.How was your first day at work?
I felt a little overwhelmed with all the volunteers coming to me asking all the ins
and outs (all the details) , but very excited at the same time. All of the stress
was worth it when I saw the smiles of the children. Actually, they tackled me
(to jump on and push to the ground) to ground with hugs!
19.4.Do you prefer part time or full time job? Why?

Well, of course I would rather have a part-time job! If I had a part-time job, I
would invest the rest of my time to do the things that truly interest me, such as
yoga, meditation, see family and friends, etc. I’m sure we would all feel happier
if we were able to do this. Unfortunately, the problem is the money though!
19.5.Which job did you want to do when you were a child?
I used to dream of being a zookeeper. I have no clue why I thought it would be
enjoyable to clean up after large, exotic animals! I guess I always loved animals.
Anyway, this dream has passed!
19.6.Which job do you prefer in the future?
I would like to continue in the volunteer field, but keep expanding the projects.
For example, I have dreamt of going to remote villages in the mountains and
educating the people about public health, as it is a big problem in Peru. I hope
to aid in (to help) reducing preventable disease.
19.7.Describe your education
I’m on a 5 year study plan, so I’ll finish in 2 years. Next year, I’ll begin my
internship at a clinic for substance addicts. I really look forward to that hands on
experience. After my Bachelor’s, I plan to go onto my Master’s, perhaps even
my PhD.
19.8.What is your area of specialization?
I’m a Psychology major with a minor in Spanish language.
19.9.Why did you choose to study that major?
As I’ve always been fascinated by how the mind works, I felt that Psychology
was the ideal field of study for me. Furthermore, I believe I have wonderful
interpersonal skills and can easily connect and empathize with others, making
me the perfect fit.
19.10.What was your favourite subject as a child?
I’ve always loved Art because it helps me relax and well, I’m quite good at it.
After all the strenuous hours of book work in the other classes, it was always a

relief for me to come to my canvas. I feel that Art is an incredible outlet (a way
to express feelings) for me.
19.11.Do you think your country has an effective education system?
To an extent yes, but I also think it can be too theoretical at times. I think they
need to teach us how to use the information we learn more rather than just have
us memorize for the exam. All in all, I cannot complain too much though.
19.12.Are you looking forward to working?
Absolutely! I cannot wait to put into effect what I’ve been learning for years now.
I’m eager to help people with the psychological struggles that they face. I
believe I can make a difference in the world.

### 20. Travel & Festival

20.1. Do you like traveling?
Not really actually! I’m more of a creature of habit (someone who doesn't
like changes to routine) , so I’m usually not keen to change my daily routine.
When I change it up, I often feel anxious and disoriented (not a clear mind).
Furthermore, I have a fear or airplanes and get carsick, so traveling just isn’t for
me.
20.2. Do you often travel by air?
Not at all! I try to avoid it at all costs (very seriously). If I must travel, I will take
some motion sickness (getting sick from any kind of transportation)
medicine and go by car or train. I was once on an airplane on my honeymoon
that came very near to crashing, so my phobia (strong fear) stems from
(comes from. Stem is the part where the flower grows) this.
20.3. How long was the longest trip you took?
I once had to go on business to the Philippines. It was a 24 hour flight! It was a
nightmare (we saw this when something is very terrible). On top of this, I
was seated next to a child who was relentlessly (not stopping) crying during
the entire journey.

20.4. Which country would you like to travel to in the future?
I’m dying to (I really want to) go to Egypt. I’ve always dreamt of going there
since I was a child, actually. I’m really fascinated by their ancient culture. I would
be in awe of (amazed by) the Grand Pyramids I’m sure. Unfortunately, since I
despise (hate) flying, I dont think I’ll ever get there.
20.5. Would you like to travel to space?
Perhaps! I’m not sure how it feels to be in a rocket. I think it would be incredible
to see a completely foreign galaxy (another world). I’m curious if other life
forms (aliens) exist, so I would definitely go along on this journey to find out for
myself. I also wonder if the moon is made out of cheese!
20.6. What is your favorite festival?
Hmm, that’s a tough question because I’m definitely a holiday person (a
person who likes holidays) , but I would have to say New Years Eve. I’m
always keen (want) for change and new beginnings, so I love setting new goals
at the start of each new year, not to mention I really enjoy the parties. Second
to this would be Valentine’s Day, since I’m a hopeless romantic (a very
romantic person).
20.7. How do you celebrate the festival?
In my culture, it’s more very family-oriented holiday. We usually have a special
family dinner at home followed by the countdown to midnight. However, in my
culture we add something special to it. At the clock ticks down to midnight, we
eat 12 grapes which signify a different wish for each month. After this, we go
out to the city or town streets to drink with our friends and wish them a happy
new year.
20.8. What is the most popular festival in your country?
Definitely Christmas, since I’m from a Catholic country. Nearly every town and
city goes out of the way to deck (decorate) the streets out with Christmas lights
and decorations. However, unlike other countries, we celebrate the epiphany,
or day of the three wise men, on January 6 just as much at the 25th. This is the
day in which we exchange gifts and watch parades.

20.9. Do you like western festivals?
Of course! They are part of my culture. I especially love Christmas, Easter, and
New Years since they have always been part of my upbringing (childhood).
However, I also find eastern festivals interesting. I lived in Vietnam for 2 years,
and I was in awe (amazed) of the Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn festival.
20.10. Where do people usually go during festivals?
Between homes and the streets. We hold meals in our homes for the holidays,
as we value home-cooked meals. However, we are people who enjoy going out,
so we often go out to celebrate at bars or even in the streets. For example, the
Christmas Eve celebration entails going to a bar with friends until the wee hours
(early hours) of the morning, followed by a family lunch the next day.
20.11.Do you like travelling?
I adore it! I definitely caught the travel bug (became addicted to) after my
first trip abroad in 2011 to Australia. Since I first discovered the thrill of being
lost in a new place, I have become an avid traveler.
20.12.Do you like travelling long distance?
Yes, I do! I don’t mind the long flights or jet lag whatsoever. I am thrilled by
discovering other cultures and customs completely opposite from my homeland.
Actually, I never fear what’s foreign to me.
20.13.Do you often travel by plane?
Several times a year, sometimes even once a month. I’m a travel addict, so I
always have my next plane ticket booked to keep me going. Although I don’t
have a high salary, I always find a way to fly via discount airlines and saving
year-round.
20.14.Would you say your country is a good place for tourists to visit?
For sure! We have a wide range of ecosystems- from the Amazon Rainforest,
The Iguazu Waterfalls, to the pristine coastlines. Brazil has so much rich culture
and festivals to offer to tourists, not to mention the warm, fun-loving people.

20.15.In which season do you prefer to travel?
As I have 4 weeks of vacation in the winter, I prefer to travel during this time. I
usually spend Christmas with my family in Brazil, then travel around to my
neighboring countries. Actually, last year I traveled to Canada and now this year
I will go to Vietnam Cambodia, and Thailand.
20.16.What was your first travel in your life?
Fortunately, the first trip I ever took abroad was to Australia. My parents sent
me to stay with a host family in Australia to learn English while I traveled. Along
with Australia, I visited New Zealand the the island of Fiji.
20.17.Where do you plan to travel next?
This coming year, I have a trip planned to Southeast Asia- to Vietnam,
Cambodia, and Thailand with my husband. We will begin in Bangkok and
discover the islands and elephant sanctuaries of Thailand, then move onto
Hanoi, Vietnam and ride motorbikes to the south, then enter Cambodia to visit
Angor Wat and Phnom Pen. I can’t wait to discover this part of the world!

### 21. Street Markets

21.1. Do you like going to street markets?
I love it! I love the whole experience of seeing people selling their products, as
well as I believe that the freshest produce comes from there. I would much
rather go to a street market than a large name brand supermarket, where the
produce is treated with pesticides and other chemicals to keep it from perishing.
21.2. Are there many street markets in your country?
Not really. There a few farmer’s market, but they aren’t very common. People
usually do their grocery shopping at large supermarkets.
21.3. What do people usually buy at street markets?
I’d say the most common items are fresh fruits and vegetables, maybe even
meats or fish as well. However, the farmer’s markets in my town tend to only
sell fruits, vegetables, and local products such as honey from their bee farming.

21.4. What is the difference between street markets and supermarkets?
Street markets have fresher products and usually involve local people or
farmers coming to sell their products, whereas supermarkets sell more
commercialized products. Although street market food may be tasty and fresh,
supermarket food can be safer since they have tighter restrictions from the FDA
(Food and Drug Administration).

### 22. Playing

22.1. Where did you play when you were a child?
As I grew up in an outdoorsy (someone who likes nature) family, I always
used to play outside in my yard. Since we lived on a large piece of property that
was partly wooded, I often used to play in there and find creatures such as
snakes, turtles, salamanders (a lizard-like animal) , frogs, or other critters. As
a kid, I was never afraid of creepy crawlers (scary insects like spiders)! On
rainy days, I would come inside and spend hours by my doll house or coloring.
22.2. Did you play at your friend's home?
Yes, I did! I had a few best friends, so we would often set up playdates (when
parent arrange a time for their kids to play together). All of my friends also
had big yards, so we would play tag, jump on the trampoline, play hide and
seek, etc. One of my friends had a Nintendo Game Cube which I didn’t have,
so we would spend hours playing Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.
22.3. Did you prefer to play outside or inside when you were young?
Definitely outside! I always had more fun in my sandbox or finding critters
(small animals/insects) rather than sitting inside playing games or watching
TV. I know that no matter how much I change, I’ll always be an outdoorsy
person.
22.4. Do you think it’s important for children to play outside?
Very! Nowadays, I feel sad that children are glued to (always attached to)
video games and TV rather than spending time taking in breaths of fresh air. Of

course some video games and cartoons are okay, but I think children should
spend more time outdoors to benefit their mental and physical health.

### 23. Sports/ Physical Exercises

23.1. Do you like to watch sports on TV?
Not at all! I despise (hate) it. I get extremely bored and disinterested. I usually
try to avoid watching sports on TV at all costs unless it’s an exciting event, like
the World Cup or Super Bowl. In that case, I go for the social event rather than
the game itself.
23.2. Do you play any sports?
Not anymore. I was an avid (enthusiastic) swimmer as a child, but I gave that
up after high school, as it was quite time-consuming. Nowadays, I enjoy going
to the gym, running around the lake by my house, and going on mountain treks.
I’m not sure if these are considered sports, but I’m really into physical activity.
23.3. Which is the popular sports in your country?
Soccer of course! As soccer is the sport of the world, that would be number one.
People go wild when our team wins a game- they even drive around waving
flags, blocking off the streets! Apart from this, many people enjoy playing tennis
and doing martial arts.
23.4. Who is your favorite sports star?
As I’m not a big sports fan, I don't really have one. However, I think I may like
Cristiano Ronaldo. Although I don't know anything about him or his athletic
abilities, I think I've always been drawn to him (attracted to) because of his
looks.
23.5. What kinds of sports would you like to try in the future?
I’m really intrigued by soccer. I think it’s something that can really connect
people, as well as is good cardiovascular and coordination activity. Actually, I
wish I had gotten into it as a child. I think it would be interesting to join a league
in my city.

23.6. Do you do any physical exercise?
You could call me a couch potato (a lazy person who sits on the sofa a lot.
“Couch” is another word for sofa). I’m naturally thin without any exercise, so
I’m quite lazy when it comes to exercise. I do go for mountain hikes, but I should
definitely do more to gain muscle.
23.7. Do young people in your country like to do exercise?
Gyms are not very popular in my country because of the cost, but I would say
that people get their fair share of exercise everyday because of the hills in the
city. Many people climb a mountain to their home every single day! I used to
live in a house that was unreachable by car and a total of 200 stairs to get there!
23.8. Do you think people are keen on doing physical activity? Why?
Well, I think they are quite accustomed to it. I don’t think they would be too keen
on going to the gym, but they really enjoy going on mountain hikes. Since our
religion is based upon the Mother Earth and the Mountain Gods, these treks are
a spiritual journey.

### 24. Hometown

24.1. Please describe your hometown a little
Where do I begin? My hometown is marvelous. It was the heart of (the center
of) the Inca Empire, and is home many ancient Inca ruins, especially Machu
Picchu. It lies at 3,100 meters up in the mountains. You can do a lot of trekking,
site seeing, visit incredible natural landscapes, etc. It’s a perfect mixture of the
ancient and modern world.
24.2. How long have you been living there?
I was born and raised in Cusco. I’ve lived there for my entire life, except for
when I went to Lima, the capital city, to study my Bachelor’s Degree. After that,
I needed to escape the hustle and bustle (noise from a big city) and come
back to my lovely town.
24.3. What do you like (most) about your hometown?

I love that it’s a mix between the ancient and modern world. Furthermore, I like
the mix of the indigenous (native people) and Spanish influence. Sometimes
it feels like I’m walking in the shoes of the Incas. Furthermore, there is definitely
a warm, friendly feel to the town which makes it a pleasant place to live.
24.4. Would you like to live there in the future?
Although my city is magical, I would consider moving somewhere else in the
world. I think sometimes people become too accustomed to (used to) their
daily routine. So, perhaps when and if I have a family, I would consider moving
to another country in South America or to Spain. It would be our adventure!

### 25. Walking

25.1.Do you like to walk?
I love it! I’d say it’s my preferred method of travel. For one, I feel relaxed when
I walk, so I feel it improves my mental health. Furthermore, I like to lead a
healthy lifestyle , so walking helps me achieve this.
25.2. Do you walk very much?
As often as possible. I have to drive to work, but I try to get my steps in by
walking to places that are close enough from my house- such as the pharmacy,
grocery store, and corner store. Moreover, the weather has been delightful, so
I try to go on an evening stroll (walk) at least 3 times a week at sunset.
25.3. Do you like to walk on your own or with friends?
To be honest, I kind of prefer to walk alone. For one, I’m kind of a slow walker,
so I don’t like it when other people pressure (pressure somebody to do
something to persuade somebody to do something) me to stay at their pace
(speed). By the same token, I enjoy the self-reflection time I have when I walk.
25.4. Would you say your city is a good place for walking?
Not really. For one, it’s extremely hot and humid, so that makes it difficult to
walk. Furthermore, almost everyone owns a car, so walking isn’t very common.

However, there are sidewalks and beach promenades (a path for walking
on) , so walking is a possibility.
25.5.Do you spend enough time walking?
A fair amount, but I would like to do more. I walk at every opportunity I have,
but I would like to integrate it into my daily routine more. For example, maybe
I can map out (plan) a way to walk to a public transportation stop to get to work
instead of simply jumping in (getting in) my car.
25.6.Do you walk more often now than (you did) in the past?
Yes, I do. As I’ve gotten heavier with age, I’ve started to make changes in my
lifestyle, which includes more walking. I notice now that I walk more, I feel more
limber (able to stretch).
25.7.Do you think people will be walking more in the future?
I doubt it. I imagine that as technology continues to advance, less and less
people will want to rely on their own two feet. You can even see instances
(examples) of this now, as renting bikes and scooters is now the norm (the
usual) on every corner.

### 26. Weather

26.1. Do you like hot weather?
I’m used to it. My city is very hot and humid, so it’s something I’m built for. I
adapt by buying clothes that withstand sweat well, such as cotton or linen. On
the other hand, I avoid materials like silk or wool that cause one to sweat more
and/or feel sticky.
26.2. What kind of weather is typical in your hometown?
It’s a jungle climate, so it’s quite hot all year long. During wet season, it is
extremely humid and sticky. For many, the climate is hard to take. For me, I’m
used to it. I don’t even sweat profusely (sweat a lot).
26.2. What do you do in hot weather?

Since I live close to the coast, I often go to the beach on hot days. I also have
a pool in my apartment complex, so you can often find me there on hot days,
as well. On days that are unbearable, I stay inside in the air conditioning and
watch TV or go to the gym.
26.3. What is your favorite season?
I would say dry season. It’s difficult to get around during wet season during a
downpour since our culture is to go around by motorbike, not to mention that
the streets flood easily. All in all, it’s a hassle (annoying or difficult). So, I
much prefer the dry season since it’s a dry, more bearable heat.
26.3. Would you like to visit a hot country?
Sure! It’s something I’m used to. I am interested in countries in Asia and the
Middle East, such as India, Cambodia, and Saudi Arabia, and the heat wouldn’t
stop me from visiting there. I would simply wear breathable clothes and stay
inside during the peak heat hours.
26.4. Do you like wet weather?
No! I don’t know why, but I tend to feel a little down in the dumps (depressed)
in the rain. I especially feel that way when I wake up in the morning and it’s still
dark. So, a sunny climate definitely suits me better!
26.5. How many seasons are there in your place?
Two seasons- wet and dry. They each last about half the year. In wet season,
there are downpours (extreme, heavy rain) and it’s generally humid and
sticky. In dry season, it is a dry heat. I find dry season to be a lot more
comfortable although the flora in wet season is more impressive.
26.7. What kind of weather do you like most?
If I could choose, I would say about 28 degrees, dry, with a cool breeze. This
would be ideal whether to go for a motorbike ride around the countryside or lie
out on the beach. Since I don’t like extremes , this would be perfect for me.

### 27. City/ Countryside

27 .1. Do you like the city you are living in now?
Yes, I really enjoy ABC city. Although it’s quite hectic, I love the liveliness of it.
Apart from this, I think it’s exciting since it is developing at a rapid pace
(quickly) and I love the international environment. This city never sleeps!
27.2. Which city have you been to recently?
I recently visited Bangkok for a short holiday. I had about 3 days free, so I went
there to visit the floating market, palaces, Buddhist temples, and vibrant city
center.
27.3. Do you prefer the city or the countryside?
I would say I’m definitely a city person. I enjoy the hustle and bustle
(craziness) of city life, along with the endless opportunities to meet new people
from all over. I feel too limited in the countryside, not to mention I’m terrified of
critters (small animals, like spiders, etc).
27.4. What kinds of city do you like?
A mix of modern and old. I like when there is an old historic quarter, but also a
district with skyscrapers and a more futuristic look. Moreover, I require a city
with friendly people and smiles- I couldn't live in fast-paced, robotic (people
moving so fast that they don't have any expression) place like New York
City for example.
27.5. Which city do you want to go to?
I’ve always dreamt of going to San Francisco. I’ve always seen the Golden Gate
Bridge, charming doll-house like homes, and cable cars on TV and imagined
myself there. Moreover, San Francisco seems to be a very liberal city which I
would be into.
27.6. Have you ever lived in the countryside?
Yes, I was born there! I grew up in the countryside. Actually, my backyard was
a cornfield and some people even used to drive to my high school in tractors!
Running around barefoot (without shoes) in the mud and frolicking around
(running) open fields has always been a part of my life.

27.7. What do you like to do in the countryside?
Firstly, I like the outdoor activities, such as playing outside, gardening, going for
walks and hikes, and going swimming. Secondly, I love the time I have to self-
reflect and find deep relaxation. Sometimes I even like to do meditation or
yoga in a field.
27.8. What do people living in the countryside like to do?
I imagine they like the outdoor activities, such as farming, gardening, going for
walks, swimming, hiking, etc. I guess that they also like to have gatherings,
maybe even barbecues and bonfires (a large outdoor fire) , too. Lastly, I would
think they like to go on trips to cities on the weekends as a change of scenery.

### 28. Patience

28.1. Do you have patience?
Not at all! I’m quite an impatient person. I often feel on edge (stressed),
especially when I’m behind the wheel or waiting in line. Moreover, I like
immediate gratification, so I tend to lose my patience when I cannot obtain this.
This is one my biggest downfalls (bad personality traits).
28.2. Do most people in your country have patience?
Not really. Since I come from a country of people who are used to having all
conveniences at their fingertips (something easily accessible), they often
become impatient when this doesn't happen. Furthermore, people spend a lot
of time commuting (traveling from home to work) to their offices in the
mornings, which tends to leave them feeling antsy (anxious) as well as angry
at other drivers.
28.3. Have you ever lost patience?
Who hasn’t? There have been several instances. I once became quite impatient
while I was waiting in a convenience store, not to mention with people cutting

the line repeatedly, and I just left my items there idly (not doing anything)
and stormed out (left angrily) of the store.
28.4. When do you need patience the most?
That’s a difficult question. I think having patience in general is quite a virtue (a
good trait). I think it’s good to have it with your life in general. When you have
this, I imagine your life goes more at ease from step to step. Moreover, I think
it’s important to have it with your children so that they aren’t raised in an angry
environment, and furthermore so they can develop it later on in life.

### 29. Pets/ Wild Animals

29.1. What's your favorite animal?
Hm.. I would have to say whales. I’ve been fascinated by them ever since I was
a child. There’s just something so majestic about them, maybe it has to do with
(is related to) their size. Plus they are highly intelligent and family-oriented
creatures. It’s believed that they even speak their own languages!
29.2. Do you like to see animals in the zoo?
Not really. Sure, it’s interesting to see them, but I also feel sad seeing them in
cages. In my opinion, wild animals should not be in captivity (caged) unless
they have some sort of injury. Actually, I think it’s a shame that humans feel the
need to see nature so badly that they cage them and charge people to enter.
29.3. Do you keep a pet?
Not currently. I would like to, but I’m actually not allowed to because of my
apartment regulations. Additionally, I live in a small studio apartment so it
wouldn't be the best environment for a pet, unless it were a cat or small animal.
Moreover, I work full-time so I wouldn't have a lot of time to tend to the pet.
29.4. Did you have a pet when you were young?
Yes, I did. My parents were both animal lovers (people who love animals) ,
so we always had a house full of pets. My first pet was a lizard named Charlie,
then onto my very own black kitten named Pal. Although I played too hard with

my pets and made them annoyed, I still got a lot of joy from them. Additionally,
I also learned a sense of responsibility from a young age.
29.5.What pet will you have later?
Hmm. I think I want a dog and a cat. When I think about it more, I cannot imagine
having a family without a dog for my children one day. I can envision them
playing with a Golden Retriever or a Labrador retriever, as they have a friendly
demeanor (way of being). On the other hand, I’m more of a cat person (a
person who prefers cats to dogs), so I would like to have one as well.
29.6. If you raise children in the future, will you allow them to keep a pet?
Yes, for sure. I would like to make their dreams come true of having a pet, as
many children want. Moreover, I feel a pet is a great addition to a family. Lastly,
I think allowing them to have a pet is a good opportunity for them to begin to
have a sense of responsibility when it comes to walking their pet, changing the
litter box (the box where cats go to the bathroom) , feeding them, cleaning
the cage, etc.

### 30. Dance

30.1. Do you like to dance? (Why?/Why not?)
Yes, I do! Although I don't know how to formally dance very well, I enjoy l etting
loose (relaxing; not caring what others thing) and dancing with my friends.
There is something about dancing that makes me feel incredibly carefree (fully
relaxed). Furthermore, it’s a good way to exercise.
30.2. Have you ever learned to dance?
Yes, I have! When I was about 4 years old, my parents signed me up for ballet.
Actually, I hated it with a burning passion back then. I would often burst into
tears (to cry hard) before recitals and try to play sick (pretend to be sick to
avoid something). Furthermore, we learned swing dancing, square-dancing,
and ballroom dancing in school, which were humiliating at the time!
30.3. When was the last time you danced?

It’s been a while. Since my group of friends aren't into dancing, I haven't been
out to a club for a while. However, I often dance around my apartment with
music as a way to de-stress.
30.4. What kind of dancing do people in your country like?
It seems like many people are into salsa and bachata these days. I’m seeing
more and more Facebook ads for these particular dances. Moreover, are into
hip-hop dancing, as well as dancing along to EDM music.
30.5. Why do you think some (or, many) people like dancing?
I would say because it’s a way to let loose. Moreover, it’s a way of self-
expression for many, especially those who are more talented. When you hit (go
to) the dance floor, it seems like all your worries go away and you simply focus
on the movements of your body.
30.6. Do you think there are any benefits for young people to go dancing?
Without a doubt! It’s important to know how to let loose and have fun, for one.
Secondly, it builds confidence. I remember feeling really shy to dance in front
of others as a child, but once I just did it, I stopped caring. Lastly, it’s an
enjoyable form of exercise and builds certain skills, like flexibility, posture, etc.

### 31. Haircut

31.1. Do you like your current hair style?
Not really. I feel that I’m well-due for a change. I think my hair looks fine, but it’s
missing some extra flare (details) to really stand out (be noticed). For
example, it’s just an average brown color with a straight, medium-length cut.
31.2. Have you had a haircut that you didn't like?
Countless times! I usually leave the hair salon almost in tears, even though I
always fake a smile to them and leave a tip to not be rude. I can remember one
time I asked for just a trim (cutting a small amount), and she cut several
inches off!

31.3. How often do you have your hair cut?
Having split ends (when your hair breaks at the ends) is a pet peeve
(something that annoys me) of mine, so I usually go about once every 2
months. I could go less, but looking at my ends makes me crazy, so I make an
appointment whenever they show up (appear). Furthermore, your hair grows
healthier if you trim it often.
31.4. When was the last time you had your hair cut?
About 3 weeks ago. I didn’t really have the extra cash for it, but I decided to do
it because I had a professional photoshoot coming up , so I wanted my hair to
look its best.
31.5. How much do you usually spend on a haircut?
Usually about $40 after a 20% tip. Unfortunately, the beauty industry is very
expensive in my country, so even this ridiculous price is the lowest I can find.
Because of this, it takes a toll on me (costs me a lot of money) every time I
get a haircut.
31.6. Do you often (or, ever) change your hairstyle?
I do every so often. I sometimes switch back from dark hair to blonde hair.
Actually, I had blonde, short hair for 2 years back in 2016, but now I have a
medium-length chestnut brown hair style. I’m going back and forth (trying to
make a decision) with going back to blonde right now!
31.7. What's your favourite hairstyle?
Hmm. Well, for me, I think I look best with a medium or long hair length and a
dark brown color. However, for other girls, I love a short bleach blonde hair style,
maybe even mixed with some wild colors, such as pink or blue. I know I couldn’t
pull it off (look good), but I still adore that edgy (uncommon) style!
31.8. Would you like to change the colour of your hair?
Yes! Right now it’s a chestnut brown color, but I would rather it be a deep, dark
chocolate brown or maybe even a blonde color. I like it to be one extreme or
the other- I don’t like the in between stage it’s in right now. The struggle is, the

dark hair brings out (shows) my eyes more, but the blonde color is a change
and makes me feel sassy (with attitude).

### 32. Voice

32.1. Do you like recording and hearing your (own) voice?
Not at all! To be honest, I don’t like the sound of my voice, as I’ve always been
told it’s very deep for a woman. I’ve even been mistaken as a man on the phone
before! Because of this, I’ve never liked my voice.
32.2. Do any members of your family have a similar voice (or, similar
voices)?
Not really. Mine is very unique. My father has a southern accent, and my sister
has more of a girly-girl (very feminine) accent. So, I’m the odd ball out (the
strange one) with my deep voice.
32.3. Are there any situations when your voice changes?
Yes- for example when I talk on the phone to clients at work. I usually put on a
more polite voice and always maintain a positive tone. On the other hand, I
talk more freely with my friends and family on the phone, without concern of
whether I sound polite or not.
32.4. Is your voice the same now as it was when you were younger?
Not really. It’s always been deep, but it’s definitely gotten deeper as I’ve aged.
Furthermore, now that I’m an English teacher, I’ve begun to enunciate
(pronounce clearly) my words better so that language learners can understand
me.

### 33. Jeans

33.1. Do you like wearing jeans?

Not too much. For some reason, I don’t feel attractive when I wear them. I much
prefer a dress or romper instead. When I wear jeans, I feel too plain and not
elegant enough. Furthermore, it’s hot and humid where I live, so jeans tend to
stick to me.
33.2. How often do you wear jeans?
Just from December to February, as my city is constantly hot. I wear them for
casual outfits and sometimes even dress them up with a cute top and heels to
go out at night. However, in the summer, as little clothes as possible is best in
my city with its heat.
33.3. When did you start wearing jeans?
Ever since I can remember! Jeans are a stitch (centra)l in all of our wardrobes
in my country. My parents dressed me in jeans ever since I was a small child,
and I’ve carried this through to adulthood.
33.4. Did you wear jeans at school?
No, never. As I attended a Catholic school, I was always obligated to wear a
uniform, which consisted of a button-up blouse, pleated skirt, knee high socks,
and dress shoes. We occasionally had dress-down (casual) days where we
could wear our own clothes, though. In that case, yes I wore jeans.
33.5. Would you say jeans are popular in your country?
Very much so! They are an essential. People wear them in all different shapes,
sizes, and colors. Along with blue jeans, people also like to wear black, white,
and bright colored jeans. Moreover, people tend to dress up black or white jeans
for work quite often.
33.6. Would you buy an expensive pair of jeans?
Hmm, perhaps. I would much rather buy an expensive dress or high heels, but
I can see how buying a pair of expensive jeans in worthwhile (meaningful).
For example, you may buy a pair of Levi jeans that last you a lifetime!

### 34. Concentration

34.1. When do you need to stay (or, be) focused?
As I’m a freelancer (someone who does independent work online), I really
need to hone in (focus in) on getting my work done. I tend to space out
(become unfocused) when I have to sit down and finish a task, so I really need
to work on that to be more efficient. Furthermore, I need to concentrate on
finding a new house, as my lease will expire soon.
34.2. Do you ever find it difficult to stay focused (= hard to concentrate)?
Every day. I tend to have a lot running through my mind, so it’s hard to focus in
on just one thing. When I try to read or work on an independent project, my
mind tends to wander (go without direction) and I usually turn to checking my
phone and searching unrelated topics.
34.3. What distracts you when you're trying to stay focused?
Number one: my phone! I get distracted when I receive a text message or email,
then lose my current thought and think about that. Furthermore, if I try not to
respond, I will obsess over it until I finally put down my work to address it. Aside
from this, I get distracted when I’m going through certain personal problems,
such as a break-up or family dilemma (problem).
34.4. What d o you do to help you concentrate?
When I sit down to do work, I make a point of (try) putting my phone on silent
and away from me. Furthermore, I do exercise before which often brings my
mind back to focus. Lastly, I try to work in a quiet place, such as my bedroom,
which doesn’t have many distractions around.
